Readme HW3

In this assignment for theory questions 
diagonal length = sqrt(width^2 + height^2)
r = diagonal length *2 
size of Hough transform accumulator = number of possible angles * number of possible distances

N = log(1 - P) / log(1 - p^D)

for Generate Fake Data I got an image that looks like the same in the example.

for Hough Transform for a Line, I provide two images that have the line showing in the image.

for Hough Transform for Circle, I got the circle where it shows the x,y,r.

for Apply to a Real Image I tried and it shows the circle which is red.
(x0,y0,r) = (184.165188,142.681713,74.037164)

for Additional Circles, I apply the same thing to get the other circles too.
Circle 1: (x0,y0,r) = (184.165188,142.681713,74.037164)
Circle 2: (x0,y0,r) = (336.553328,248.017919,63.597544)
Circle 3: (x0,y0,r) = (400.544692,109.670774,44.454298)
Circle 4: (x0,y0,r) = (279.307357,374.597988,42.237040)
Circle 5: (x0,y0,r) = (527.722224,199.456264,42.032820)
Circle 6: (x0,y0,r) = (108.113323,383.954081,29.525538)
Circle 7: (x0,y0,r) = (130.318022,285.805473,25.920350
