Readme HW1

input_1.jpg is the main image where I perform all the functions on it like greyscale, etc.

Computer_Vision_HW1.pdf is the PDF file which is generate from HW1.tex and this is the PDF file which has answers in it.

Hw1.m has all the source code file which you can simply copy and paste in Matlab to generate the result.

In HW1 First I start with Theory Questions basically understanding the theory part from lecture very well.
In dataset I use dragon statue image which is having good colors in it.
RGB to grayscale using the formula Gray = 0.2989R + 0.5870 ∗ G + 0.1140B figure out and shown the result.
RGB to Binary in that set the thresholds to 25%,50%,75% where I see the differences.
Gamma Correction in that we use formula s = rγ and change the value of γ to 0.2,1,50.
Changing Hue is something related for me after grayscale basically sometimes we try black and white picture use filter in phone to checkout. Same like Hue while editing the picture we change the Hue saturation and etc.
In histograms we use bar to show the grayscale red channel green channel and blue channel.

This first assignment looks good start to the course and tried everything on input_1 image which is dragon statue image.
