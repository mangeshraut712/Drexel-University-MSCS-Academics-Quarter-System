To achieve our goal, we employed the keyword spotting method, which accepts a text as input, tokenizes it, and then identifies the emotions to be classified in the final step.In the first step, a function is defined to load our dataset so it can be counted and visualized. Then, the sentiments are redefined(e.g., combining happiness and fun). After that, exploratory data analysis is employed to check the trends using visualization. Furthermore, sentiment analysis is done using the Textblob library, and our sentiments are classified as positive, negative, or neutral.In the next phase, the redefined dataset is cleaned by making everything lowercase and removing items such as URLs, Twitter handles, and punctuation. Afterward, the keywords are extracted from each sentiment and then represented and visualized. Then, the frequency of each sentiment is calculated, and statistical modeling begins by creating a sentiment data frame. Finally, naive Bayes and logistic regression methods are employed to classify our sentiments.The tweets database was obtained from the Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Community (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pashupatigupta/emotion-detection-from-text).
