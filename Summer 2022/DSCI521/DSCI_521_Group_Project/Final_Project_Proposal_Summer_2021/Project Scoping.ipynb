    "Our DSCI 521 term project will explore the power generation capacity for varying energy sources across the United States. As we witness the increased effects of a changing climate, there is a growing imperative to consider alternative energy sources to traditional energy sources, such as coal and petroleum. To better constrain the feasibility of transitioning to cleaner energy, our analysis will investigate the energy generation and current capacity for nuclear, renewable and electric sources. Weâ€™ll also highlight trends in electricity net generation from coal, petroleum, natural gas, solar and wind. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will be of interest to those working in the energy sector looking to gain a deeper understanding of the current state of energy generation. Our analysis will also help provide important insight to those serving roles in climate adaptation planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we'll be relying on data sets from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA provides independent and open-source information on energy resources in the United States. Several of their datasets are relevant to our project. These include, but are not limited to, the monthly nuclear generation and generation capacity across the U.S., and electricity generation capacity from coal, natural gas, petroleum, solar and wind. \n",
    "\n",
    "The EIA maintains a database of interconnects between different transmission and generation nodules across the United States. This is a directional network of nodes. Each node has a different storage capacity (different amounts of megawatt-hours) based on the area and population that obtains its energy. Moreover, different quantities of energy traffic (megawatts) flow between each node at a given moment in time. The EIA outputs this information as CSV and JSON files. Therefore, each edge of the resulting network carries a different weight. Some nodes are standalone separately owned utilities that are not connected to anything. Therefore, this entire network can be modeled using the networkx python package, and use and consumption can be predicted using eigenvectors. An interesting analysis of this network can involve its simulation over time, and a comparison of the structure of the network as displayed with networkx can be contrasted against the plotting of these modules on the U.S. map. Analysis of the contrast between the two schematics may provide analysis of how effective (or ineffective) the current United States energy grid is operating.\n"
