DSCI 521 Group Project Drexel University Summer 2021/22

There were many challenges in creating this project. I originally worked with Mangesh, Mobin, and Will on this, but I felt like I had to do everything myself and fix all of the code that they made on top of that. I decided at the last minute to form my own group and finish the project by myself. This has caused obvious time constraints and I had to cut a lot of this project out that I would have liked to include (mentioned in future work).
All the work included in this submission is my own and Mobin and Will can attest to that. Their project does include some of mine because I did work with them up until we split, but as you can see from my code here, I went about it a much different way that I consider to be better.
I would have liked to include other classifiers than just logistic regression, but I was running out of time having to do everything myself. I initially planned on also making a Naive Bayes model to compare, which I had to cut, as well as a model with the TextBlob library that gives positive/negative/neutral sentiment for each word for a comparison as more traditional NLP. The metrics I got were not the best but I think they are still good considering the quality and quantity of the data that I started with, but I think more work could be done to address the issue of text sanitization and class imbalance. Additional ideas to further this project can be found in either the PowerPoint or the Notebook under "Future Work".
