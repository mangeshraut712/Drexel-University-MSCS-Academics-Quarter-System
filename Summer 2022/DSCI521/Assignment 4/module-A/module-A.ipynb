    "__A9.__ _(7 pts)_ Now it's time to train a classifier. In particular, your job here is to write a function called `train_model(train_dat, train_lbl)` that accepts training data (however pre-processed) with labels and trains. To do this, utilize `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`, but be sure to utilize the following arguments for initializing the model's instance: \n",

    "- `max_iter=1000`, and \n",

When this function is complete, apply it to the dimensionally reduced `train_std_pca` data output in __A8__ and store the resulting classifier as `clf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The first two arguments to `LogisticRegression` specify the `solver` being used to optimize the regression (as in __Chapter 7__), and the maximum number of iterations to optimize over. However, the `multi_class='ovr'` argument is new to us! In particular, since we're trying to pick one from 10 discrete labels, i.e., `'0'`, `'1'`, `'2'`, etc., for each input record this is called a _multi-class_ classification problem. Since logistic regression isn't built for this kind of application there has to be a way to modify/enhance the algorithm to support it. As it turns out there's one way in which we can modify any binary classifier into a multi-class classifier, which is what `multi_class='ovr'` does. In particular, `'ovr'` indicates the _one vs. rest_ strategy which trains as many classifiers as there are possible outcomes in the labels. Each of the trained classifiers is trained to positively predict a given label, e.g., `'7'`, and negatively predict against all other, e.g., `not '7'`. All classifiers (10 for us) are then applied to each test record, and the classifier that offers the best positive prediction probability is then corresponds to the predicted label for the record. That's it! While the one vs. rest procedure is _general_ in its ability to convert a binary classifier into a multi-class classifier, it is a limited framework for multi-class classification, and more-precise models are generally those that do best. To see a derived multi-class logistic regression model, check out [Multinomial logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression), which can be applied by setting `solver = 'multinomial'`."
