      "review": "For anyone looking to get an Animal Crossing Edition Switch without paying more than retail price, my advice is to be patient and check back here frequently. At random times, a few consoles will be restocked and available for MSRP (thank you to the other customers in the Q&A who tipped me off about this!). Just a couple minutes after coming across that advice, I refreshed the page to test it out and this is exactly what happened. Originally it said it would take over a month to arrive but I ended up receiving it less than a week later. Just make sure the listing says \"Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\" to ensure it's not a third party seller and that the price is exactly $299.99.In terms of the product itself, I had already been playing on another Switch for a while and it's a great console (aside from the infamous joycon drift issue). My preferred play style is docked on the TV but it works perfectly on handheld mode as well. The Animal Crossing edition is super cute with its pastel joycons and ACNH-themed dock, I highly recommend it!",

      "review": "It's incredibly disappointing to see nothing but overpriced third party sellers are distributing this product, and the fact that I had to sign up on several stock-tracking websites just to have a chance at owning this console is more than disheartening.To top it all off, the game itself feels like a huge downgrade compared to its predecessor, New Leaf. Not only are several quality-of-life improvements missing, but tons of content such as the Dream Suite, Happy Home Showcases, deep sea diving, and more are absent. Why is island-visiting the only option for multiplayer when multiplayer island tours existed in New Leaf? Surely not because of hardware limitations?Villager dialogue feels empty and simple, devoid of personality aside from their preassigned type. And let's not even start on the One Island Per Switch discourse. Not only was getting ahold of this console an absolute nightmare, but having to pay $60 for a game that feels unfinished is a disgrace. We can only hope that Nintendo has plans to add content (hopefully not behind a paywall) in the future instead of relying on nostalgia to fuel sales.",

The driver handed it to me directly, which was wonderful. The colors of JoyCons are two of my favorites and are quite peaceful to look at. The dock is adorable. A refreshing alternative to the standard black. As soon as I took the Switch out of the box I applied a tempered glass screen protector on it.I was also able to transfer user data and save data over from my old Switch to this new one. Something I wasn\u2019t aware I could do, which was a very nice surprise. I really hope they get more of these beautiful consoles in stock soon for the rest of the Animal Crossing fans.",

      "review": "Definitely love how bright the colors are on this switch, more of a neon pastel shade. The switch is the V2, which has extended battery life and a more efficient CPU. Comparing this switch the the V1, the IPS panel has a warmer tint whereas the V1 is much brighter. Though color values do vary across switches. The joycons themselves are more of a matte finish on the coating rather than the glossy feel on previous joycons. The colors match well with the dock and will definitely stand out by your TV. The dock itself is a bit wider compared to the V1 allowing more wiggle room to prevent the switch from being scratched, though I do recommend purchasing a glass screen protector. The pattern on the back of the switch definitely gives it an \"animal crossing\" feel to showcasing. They did a really good job in making the pattern stand out compared to previous special edition switches.Overall, pretty happy with having a new switch that stands out and has a longer battery life. Will definitely be a well-used switch in the coming months.",

      "review": "This is my first switch console. So let me start off by saying the console itself is absolutely beautiful. The design on the back is so pretty and the joycons are gorgeous as well.My biggest issue is not the console itself. But the accessories for it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the terrible reviews for the joycons themselves. If you haven\u2019t please check them out. I had done my research on them before hand and ended up buying a different controller just because I was so nervous about using the joycons. The idea is awesome. But they feel so flimsy and cheap. I hadn\u2019t planned to even use the ones that came with the console. I planned to put them away as collectors items. But of course I had to use them to start up the console. As I was holding them I felt the plastic on the back of the right joycon move and make a loud snap. I thought I broke it and I hadn\u2019t even done anything. I was just setting up the console. The colors may look great. But after having that as my first experience I do believe all the reviews I\u2019ve seen for them.The next thing that feels awful is the dock. I had planned to play with the console docked the majority of the time. But just putting the console in makes me cringe because no matter how gentle or slow you are it still hits the sides of the dock when attempt to dock it. There\u2019s only two tiny pieces of soft rubber like material in the dock itself. Which doesn\u2019t protect the console enough. So I ended up buying a screen protector immediately just to give some protection from the dock itself. Just pushing the power button makes the console move and jiggle around in the dock, making it repeatedly hit hard plastic. It doesn\u2019t feel secure whatsoever. The actual part that connects to the switch inside of the dock is very lose as well. The door on the back of the dock also feels cheap. Reminds me of the doors on the Wii. It feels like it could pop off rather easily.Let\u2019s move on to the console a little bit. I have used the kickstand. It doesn\u2019t feel super stable and I\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t have it standing up on a very stable surface. I\u2019d be nervous to have it anywhere near children or accident prone people like me while using it. The screen looks great though. But the hdmi quality of the console menu looks horrible on my monitor. Games seem to look great though, just not the menu/home/settings etc. So I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a way to fix that or not. I play other consoles on my monitor and they look beautiful. Another thing, while holding the console with the joycons attached it feels huge. Too big, awkward, and heavy for my tiny hands and I wasn\u2019t even holding it that long. So if you are thinking about getting the switch to playing more mobile and you have tiny hands, maybe consider a switch lite? Unless you want docking and kick stand capabilities which isn\u2019t something the lite can do.The console works great. It\u2019s fast and easy to use and navigate. The buttons feel sturdy as well. I\u2019ve been playing Animal Crossing for hours while docked and the console never gets hot. Just a little warm.Overall this console was a cool idea. Just wish they would have put a little more time and money into making some parts a little more sturdy.",

Also so she could get a taste of Animal Crossing new horizons for when it comes out March 20th, 2020!The day I told her I purchased it she hopped with joy. I was excited too considering I was sharing my own excitement for animal crossing with my sister. It had finally arrived. Its box didn't come in damaged and the console was packed safely to prevent possible damages. It works perfectly as any nintendo switch should with no defects at all in the console itself. The only concerns I have to remind future buyers is that the joycons will stop working properly after a year of use. This is coming from my own nintendo switch experiences and other fellow switch owners where the controls will drift randomly while you're trying to play a game after a year after consistant use. So I'd be best to invest in a second set of controllers just in case.All I have left to say is that this was indeed worth my money and my sister couldn't be happier with her early senior graduation gift!",

You\u2019re only allowed one animal crossing switch per amazon account to allow most people to get their hands on it without the extreme price gouge. The switch looks beautiful while docked & i\u2019m a fan on the pastel blue/green & cream colored contrast. If you already played AC on another switch console, you\u2019re now able to backup & transfer all of your save data by contacting Nintendo support. It\u2019s a little tedious but, worth it if you have 100+ hours of hard work. 10/10 recommend to those who have been trying to get their hands on this in months!

Most of the reviews for switches that don\u2019t work are probably people who\u2019ve bought from 3rd party.I bought from SHIP & SOLD BY AMAZON. It came with little dust and packaging particles but I believe it was just from the warehouse storage that got into the hole the box has. I\u2019ve been playing multiplayer for 2hrs now and it works perfectly fine! If you can wait, don\u2019t buy 3rd party and do AMAZON. Totally worth it and really, really cute! I bought it MSRP btw ($299). No overpriced, scalped switch!Shipping: I bought it as a pre-order for the next month. It changed to arriving next week to this Sunday for me! There\u2019s a chance it will be the same for you too! So if you can wait, be patient, look out for pre-orders (they are available every now and then) & buy it MSRP ($299)! It\u2019ll be worth it!UPDATE AFTER 1 DAY:Just found out 1 vent on the back of the switch is loose and your able to push it in. I don\u2019t know if this will be okay but review looses a star for this :(. Works great but slight defect.",

I definitely recommend purchasing it.We bought it when it was $300 plus tax. I do not recommend paying any more than that price.. just wait till it gets back in stock & buy it for $300. Do not purchase it from greedy scalpers.. keep an eye out because as soon as it gets in stock it sells out usually the same day! We are so fortunate we were able to get one in time for my son's birthday ..we purchased this back in October & held on to it till December for his birthday. If you want one for Christmas, I doubt you will be able to get one at the $300 price ..unfortunately it's sold out till mid January.. but if you can I say go ahead & get it! This thing is adorable & really is a great collector item for any Nintendo fan! Even if they aren't into animal crossing. It is a very unisex design.

      "review": "Seller deliberately did not state that the console was for sale and use in either Korea/Phillipines/Dubia as it turned out after calling Nintendo and giving them the ups code the one I received was meant for the Phillipines. I called the seller Wacky Jacky and told them what was written on the bottom of the box, he then told me to please wait a minute while he got another from his warehouse and proceeded to verify what I said then said he was sorry and that he had no idea and that his distributor assured him it was a US (North America) console. He then said I feel really bad and was going to send me a $100 gift card but what he did was refund $100 of the purchase price thinking that I would then keep the system. I don't know why he thought I would keep the system when I already had my return authorization label printed out and told him I was returning it, never did I say I wanted to keep the system. Am I supposed to believe he didn't know it wasn't a North America console when even now he has edited his listing to let any future buyers know that what he's selling isn't intended to be sold in the US. The seller asked me to please edit my review and rating but I see no reason to change the stars although I did edit this review to include the conversation with him and the fact that he did not add a note to his product description to make buyers aware of the consoles region. BEWARE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING A SYSTEM THAT IT MAY NOT BE INTENDED FOR SALE IN THE US..... CONTACT THE SELLER BEFORE BUYING AND HAVE THEM VERIFY WHAT IS WRITTEN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX",

      "review": "I couldn't believe my luck when I was able to snag one at MSRP after the release date. It's so cute! I like the design of this one much better than the other switches, and the dock is adorable, especially if you're an Animal Crossing fan. And it's the newer version with improved battery life, too! I was thinking about getting a switch for a while, but the lack of games I absolutely had to have and the colors (I'm not a big fan of the standard colors/designs) put me off. Animal Crossing solved both of these problems with ACNH and this amazing special edition.My only complaint (other than how difficult it was to get - finally caught a restock in the middle of the night and even that sold out in less than 5 minutes) is that sometimes one of the joycons gets stuck when trying to remove it from the strap. It's probably just an issue with mine in particular, but it does make it kind of annoying to remove. I have to put some force into it, and I'm sure that one of these days, I'll accidentally scratch myself trying to remove it. Otherwise, it's very cute, and at MSRP, I'd definitely choose it over the other colors!PS - I hear that this version is restocking, at least in Japan, so absolutely do not buy from scalpers! When I was hunting for this, there were at least 100 being sold by scalpers for ~$500;now there are just over 20 for $750 each. It's cute, but it's not worth making a scalper $400+ off of other people's desperation. Just wait for a restock, or buy a regular switch and put a skin over it.",

Hope they Add more free-to-play games on Nintendo Switch, add Twitch streaming app, and more apps for gamers, and be able to use bluetooth devices and console controllers with bluetooth.Hope they make more awesome and beautiful special editions designs and art Nintendo Switch consoles in the future and with 4k/8k graphics, audio, and UHD quality.Overall awesome console to own and have with my other different home consoles to play with my family and myself.",

I don't understand why you need to place the entire tablet in-between such a cramped space where you could accidentally scratch up the device. There are so many bells and whistles that snap on and off it becomes rather annoying just to play a simple game. You can scratch up the joycons just by sliding them into the joycon grips. Why did you design it that way? The kickstand on the back of the Switch is a joke. It's so hard to open and isn't long enough to support the device. Also since, the power cord plug is directly under the device, you can't plug it in when you're using the kickstand. So many design irregularities and inconveniences. Fifty million buttons all over the place, which means fifty million ways to play one game and hold the controllers. It's so chaotic and annoying. Fun features such a streetpass and an internet browser are not on this device. This device still isn't powerful enough to compete with Playstation or Xbox. Just playing this device in your hand is a struggle because it is so freaking huge and weighty. I wouldn't buy this for a child, they can stick with the 3ds. To be honest, I had more fun playing on my 3ds and vita than the Switch.",

BUT doesn\u2019t do anything special compared to a regular Switch (other than give 10/10 on aesthetic) so don\u2019t buy unless you can afford it/the look it worth it to you.Long review:This product is amazing!! The pastel colors are so cute and the texture on the back adds a great extra touch. The dock has an AC graphic on it which was a great addition tomy living room! The packaging is also well thought out leading to a great unboxing experience. Of course this works exactly like every other Nintendo switch, so this is entirely about aesthetic.With all of that said, the price gouging on this product is insane. Because it is a limited edition the reselling price is crazy, and because it does nothing a normal Switch can\u2019t do, so purchasing this is a novelty. If you have the cash to drop go for it (I was lucky enough to get one at the normal price). But as I was hunting one down when they were first announced, I watched people buy them up and list them at inflated prices before it even came out. So maybe consider if you want to give those people your money.",

My advice for anyone reading this though : wait until October - there is an even newer model releasing. Wish I'd known at the time of purchaseEDIT: AUG 17 : About two weeks ago, it randomly said the SD card had an error and it force restarted. I didn't think anything of it since my original Switch did it once years ago and never again. Well, a few days ago this one did it again.... Now I was starting to worry. Today, just over a month later - it can't read SD cards anymore. So, I'm stuck with the native 32gb and lost all my games. Maybe I just got a bad one, but my old Switch never gave me a single problem and I regret replacing it now. Just outside the return window this thing decides to stop working.EDIT : SEPT 1 : Had to send it in to Nintendo because it had been over 30 days and I couldn't return it to Amazon. . . Nintendo erased 3000 hours of data and then replaced the system. Nintendo told me I needed to return it to the merchant for a refund, but because they replaced it, the serial number no longer matches. So, I'm stuck with a faulty system and all my game saves deleted. Worst purchase ever.",

I have a different style/color for each one so I can tell the islands apart but this one is def my fave. The Switch is my console. I have played a couple of games on ps4 (Atelier games that weren\u2019t out on Switch until more recently), but now that those games are on Switch I will get them as soon as they go on sale. I love the handheld option because I can play while my husband watches something on our tv, and I love that it can also be docked so I can see things on the big screen. I play mostly handheld. It plays smoothly with the joycons and a pro controller. You can even play with a pro controller when it\u2019s not docked if you don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t use the joycons. I\u2019m sorry about the novella. It\u2019s just enjoyable and I recommend it.",

They said that I needed to send back the game so that they could try to repair it and if that didn't work they would need to send me another game.I just returned this and got the Nintendo switch blue/red console instead. That one works perfectly without any issues so far.So although I love the Nintendo Switch I am not a fan of the animal crossing version which is why I am rating a 3.

I was bummed out when my wife took my switch hostage claiming it for herself to play Animal Crossing, especially since Monster Hunter Rise had just come out. I was even more bummed out because I had missed out on buying the MHR switch edition because my rationale mind decided I didn\u2019t need a second switch. I was left with 2 options, leave my wife & fight for custody of the switch or purchase another during the shortage brought by on by the epidemic. Surprisingly after a few months of contemplating my decision the switch prices went back down to an affordable price. It still wasn\u2019t easy finding a switch in stores so I took to the internet where I was surprised to see a brand new switch going for regular price. I quickly added the item to my cart & purchased right away! It was delivered with upmost care like a stork bringing me a new baby. Everything was brand new, I was taken back to a simpler time in my life, opening presents on Christmas day. Finally after a quick software update I could play MHR months after its release! Little to my surprise my wife quit playing Animal Crossing shortly after I got my new switch because she went down Korean Drama rabbit hole on Netflix..",

What I was not doing is pushing in the power button enough, after I pushed the Nintendo powered up. So now I own 2 Nintendo\u2019s. It\u2019s great to have 2. This new NS works great just like the old one. I could care the less about the game Animal Crossing but I like how the NS looks. Also there was waiting time if I wanted the exact one I have. Over all the NS is great! In fact I like it better then Sony play Station or X-box I don\u2019t even play them anymore. I love it I can play the old games from Nintendo and others.

We bought the Animal Crossing edition only because it would have been available earlier than the standard version. He said he didn't care how it looked as long as it could play Switch games. Originally, Amazon delivered a completely unrelated package and said it was the Switch, but their customer service sent the replacement as soon as the issue was reported. Kudos to Amazon for that. My son has only used it in handheld mode since there isn't a TV available for his use. He has never placed it in the dock so I don't know how that would work. We've had it for a couple of weeks at this point. Here is my son's review:I like it. It's been good so far. Its most impressive feature is the battery life. One charge can last for six hours of continuous gameplay. It also charges more quickly than any other device I've ever had. It goes from around 4% to 25% in 10 to 15 minutes. I'm happy I bought it.",

When everyone was talking about New Horizon during the start of the Pandemic, I thought to give it a shot. Boy, I should not have done it :) I started spending all my free time paying off my loans to Tom Nook, hunting for villagers and trying to decorate my Island. Like many, I got kinda bored after everything was unlocked and got tired of the Villagers repeating the same over and over again. I thought of resetting my Island, but didn't want to lose everything I had worked for so hard. Then Nintendo announce to release the ACNH special edition switch again and beside I didn't like the idea of buying another switch, it was a great opportunity to start another Island with an ACNH themed switch. Anyway, I didn't regret spending another $299 - the switch is VERY cute and fits perfectly on my shelf. Beside still having my old switch with a developed, but basically abandonedIsland I mostly play on the new ACNH switch now. I know it's very hard to reset your Island, but if you don't have the money to buy another system, you may want to consider it. Starting from scratch actuallydoes bring a lot of the lost magic back.",

Yes, it was overpriced, I think this was worth it, I personally got it for the Joy-cons, and I don't regret it, because you really don't know when you will get the opportunity to get one for less. Anyways, arrived in perfect condition, first switch ever, the only thing that was wrong is the Left Bumper on the Joy-con, which i don't know how to explain it but kind of loose, more than the Right Bumper. It bothers me because of something on the inside, and also since I paid a lot for this switch but not enough to complain, its just something i'll have to live with. But besides that, it was a great experience, the bumper was the only thing that gave me a fright since it feels very weird. Now I don't have anything to play since my game doesn't arrive until Wednesday, but just downloading free games is fun, but originally there is only 25gb so I would recommend getting a micro SD, but i think that's all.",

      "review": "I originally bought a Nintendo switch lite because this console was sold out everywhere and I desperately wanted to play Animal Crossing during this pandemic. I would literally check every month (since April) to see if maybe a store had this in stock, but sadly at the time, it was only third-party sellers selling at a huge markup price.By October, I decided to check one last time hoping that someone was selling at a decent price and to my surprise Amazon and several other retailers had this back in stock! Bought it right away because from my understanding this was supposed to be a limited edition item and didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to own it.Got it in no time and I love it. It\u2019s such a pretty color. It came around a good time since a lot of Switch games have gone on sale for the holiday. I still solely use my switch lite for Animal Crossing, but use my new switch for all other games.No regret purchasing it.",

I'm a huge animal crossing fan so I bought this version of Switch since I played the first one on the 3ds.Their online eshop, accessible through an online connection, has an almost endless selection of games.You can buy physical copies or digital copies of games and some are digital only through the eshop.As a longtime gamer (I own a PS4 and original owner of a regular NES I bought in 1989), I can honestly say this is Nintendo's best system since you can play it on your TV but also take it with you (portable) like a 3ds.You can also play games on it offline so you don't have to always be connected to the internet.This is a console that is great for all ages of people, young or old and when I'm tired of hack and slash on my PS4, the Switch has many chill titles of games to relax with.I'm 52 and enjoy mySwitch a lot.",

This is a way to fraud the buyer in getting a console asuming that it comes with a certain game installed because of the name and it doesn't. So I had to buy the game in the eStore as was obvious I couldn't give a gift of an Animal Crossing Console with no game of it inside... I feel scammed.

It took a while since this design is so popular but when I finally caught it during a restock period I knew I had to grab it!I love the color scheme, and seeing Tom Nook with Timmy and Tommy on a lil' island is so precious <3 The all around aesthetic makes it feel like both a console and an artpiece dedicated to your new journey on a deserted island.If you're a big AC fan who can afford to get it and you're able to grab one when they're in stock, I'd say to go for it.

      "review": "Thank you for ruining a little girls birthday... fantastic marketing strategy that has alienated a long time consumer. Zero reason to call this an Animal Crossing edition unless you want people to think the game is included. Yup at bottom of page last bullet it says game not included but why wasn't that listed first in the description, easy, cause you hope people won't see that. Last time I will attempt to make this large and type of purchase through Amazon, if I'd been in a brick and mortar I would have been able to talk it through and the clever marketing wouldn't have fooled me.",

      "review": "Personally, these joycons are two of my favorite colors. So that\u2019s already amazing. Second, if you\u2019re a big AC fan, this Switch theme is so much more meaningful. Okay, and it\u2019s the same price as the regular switch (well, when you\u2019re able to buy it from a reputable company and not with price gouging). It comes with everything you need - the device, two joycons, charger, dock, and I really want to say mine came with the hdmi cord? I got it about six months ago and have a ton of hdmi cords so I don\u2019t quite remember. It does NOT come with acnh, which is awesome if you previously shared a device.",

The dock is even cuter in person.It was packaged nicely & delivered right on time! Everything that was advertised was in the box & individually wrapped. There weren\u2019t any issues upon opening. The system runs very smoothly! My gf hasn\u2019t had any issues while playing & she\u2019s been playing it almost every day for about 2 months now.",

I also purchased a few other Nintendo switch games and enjoy them as well. One recommendation I would pass on is \u201cnot\u201d buying the actual game cartridge but buying the downloadable version as you won\u2019t worry about losing the tiny cartridge as my son did, but we later fixed them, I was upset at the thought of $60 dollars going down the drain as I should have bought the download so I wouldn\u2019t have that issue.

It is the most beautiful combination of the Switch backing, Joy-Cons, and dock that Nintendo has ever released for the Switch. The overall design, especially Nook and the Nooklings on the dock, is so cute and the pastel colors for the Joy-Cons, like all other Joy-Con colors, look so much better in person. I'm so happy to be a huge fan of Animal Crossing and receive such a beautiful Switch.Nintendo needs to manufacture a lot more of this Animal Crossing edition Switch and they need to make more themed Switches in the future.

Sold out already! Thats better than not getting one at all though. Just glad after talking with 4 people they finally listened to my point of view. Really annoying and frustrating. Never buying electronics online again. Espically not from amazon.Edit: i got a replacement and the screen is actually not broken this time.

I wish the bezel of the unit was white instead of black to continue the aesthetic, but I love the etched designs on the back regardless. Very easy to set up with my TV by following instructions on the console.",

The fact that it\u2019s the updated version of the Switch with a better battery life means I can play longer on the go, and I don\u2019t think a review of this version of the console would be complete without mentioning the gorgeous Animal Crossing New Horizons designs on the box and dock. The dock is completely white as opposed to the standard black, and features adorable artwork of Tom Nook, Timmy, and Tommy on a deserted island. The joy cons being a pastel green and blue instead of the neon I\u2019ve grown accustomed to with my parent\u2019s Switch is a great contrast. All in all this is a system I\u2019d highly recommend if you love Animal Crossing and definitely something for a collector to pick up along the way! 100% my favorite special edition version of a console!",

Just make sure its a genuine company not a private person. We got the console for not more than the classic Nintendo Switch would cost including import fees and tax. We even got some import fees back from Amazon. And what can I say, I'm totally happy with the new Switch. Love the special Joy Cons, the special AC painting on the back and the special Animal Crossing Charging Station. I even got a Message in game from Animas crossing about the new special Joy Cons. The Animal Crossing Switch has the already new battery build in. I totally recommend to buy the switch if you're an Animal Crossing fan and don't have a switch already.",

      "title": "DONT BUY FROM SCALPERS!! TARGET *MAY* RESTOCK!!!",
      "review": "Let me start by saying that I am so glad I got this switch. I didn\u2019t buy it from a scalper or even from Amazon\u2014 on launch day, Target had a few units available and pure determination had me up at 1am to order for pick-up in store and in Time Square at store opening to ensure I got my unit.Unfortunately, as is true with many Nintendo special/limited editions, a bunch of absolutely horrible, awful people have bought out these units with the intention of selling them at an inflated rate to make a profit. And sadly they succeed in their slimy business venture because of the high desirability of these items. Let me give you two reasons why you should definitely not purchase it, even as a massive Animal Crossing fan.1. TARGET MAY RESTOCK. One of my friends missed out on the Target launch day availability and she contacted the stores. They told her that they intend to restock, they just aren\u2019t aware of when. One store said that Friday, 3/20 is a likely date, but this is for a NY store so it may not be universal. Also, take into account that there are massive business slow-downs in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. That being said, Target should still have some soon. So if you can hold out, definitely do it.2. As gorgeous as this switch is, and as much as I walked 30 blocks at 6 AM in driving rain in order to get mine, it\u2019s not worth the inflated price at all. I can absolutely see myself forgetting there is anything unique about the console in a few months. In reality, the joycons are the most memorable part of the system as it is the part I see most often, while the console itself is just a pleasant little detail.It is lovely, but not worth 100+ more than original asking price. This is coming from an absolute Animal Crossing Superfan.Guys, purchasing from scalpers only encourages their behaviors and ensures a profit. If they are unable to move stock, they\u2019ll have to lower the prices to rid of the units. The fact that Target is going to restock in the first place already puts their investment on shaky ground. Additionally, sites like Amazon are supposed to have policies to protect against scalpers and exploiters (read their recent COVID-19 documents where they clearly condemn and address these actions) so if you\u2019re willing to take the time to report these scalpers, then Amazon may push them off. It\u2019ll be one less site they can operate on and hopefully start to delegitimize their practices.I know it\u2019s hard, AC Buddies, but don\u2019t give in to these jerks. Keep your eyes open for other venues that may sell, look out for those restocks, consider purchasing the dock or joycons only from Japan, and don\u2019t give in to scalpers!!!*EDIT 3/23/20* I'm making a small edit/note to this post as someone did comment on my review with their experience. Please, note that I did say that the information may not be universal because the information that I got was from a NY store, and that COVID-19 may change Target's plans/ability to restock on the console. I am only relaying information that was given to me. Thanks and good luck!",

      "review": "UPDATE 8/27/20: warning for anyone buying this on 3rd party websites like Etsy or ebay for prices like 299 or lower, beware of scammers. Unfortunately, I was scammed recently so if a deal looks like its too good to be true, it probably is.Original post:I know a lot of people didn't get a chance to grab this special edition when it was first released, and although it was released again shortly, it was sold out in minutes. The most recent restock/release was in July 2020 in Australia, but people also reported that it was hard to find a store that carried it before being all sold out. So how are you going to get your hands on this without paying for the 3rd party price tag that is double or even triple the original $299.99?1) You can actually buy the exact sky blue/mint green colored joy-con hard replacement cases from a lot of sellers on Amazon for roughly $20.2) You can buy the exact animal crossing special edition black hard plate from a lot of sellers on ebay for roughly $20, and you can install it on yourself.3) If you don't want to DIY yourself, and would rather get the actual legit Nintendo product, do not fret! People have reportedly contacted Nintendo stores, and the staff said this is not a limited edition, so it will be restocked every now and then in the future! It is released in small quantities at a time due to the manufacturing issues.You will all have to be very patient.For those of people who already have a switch, and just like the aesthetic of the animal crossing edition, just buy the replacement parts separately and DIY yourself. Why spend $500+ for a switch you already have and reward a 3rd party seller for taking advantage of you? Instead spend no more than $50, and just DIY the case yourself!",

BUT It is possible to get one! It only requires a little patience and checking back periodically! I've been checking back since 11 PM PST yesterday. For reference, amazon has restocked about 4 times since then. Each window lasting about 5 minutes. I finally snagged one this morning at about 4:30 AM PST. Amazon is opening up small windows where they are selling original (new) stock, periodically every couple of hours. So don't give up hope! I wouldn't buy from a third party unless you absolutely want to and feel that you have to in order to obtain one! Good luck and happy hunting!",

      "review": "So I didn't purchase the Animal Crossing console on Amazon \u2014 But I did buy it at my local Meijers store on sale during the holiday season. I have the Nintendo Lite (in yellow) and I decided to purchase the Animal Crossing console mainly because I wanted a better screen, and be able to change out the controllers in case one goes bad. I also wanted the ability to play games on my TV. I like how the dock is minimalistic enough to not take up a lot of space on my TV stand \u2014 It's also a quick and easy set up! Also love that I can charge my switch on the dock without having to take out the power cable and plugging it somewhere.The controller colors are so pretty! I love pastel colors and I wish Nintendo made more pastel colored controllers. I like their colored controllers that they have out now in the store, but I just really like the pastel colors more, which was one of the reasons why I picked the ACNH console. I also love the subtle embossing of the Animal crossing characters and seasons on the back of the console. I think that's a cute touch! The dock itself is also super cute. I love Tom, Timmy, and Tommy in Animal crossing (probably one of my favorite characters) so I was excited to see them on the Dock! I've been a LOT of animal crossing so the theme of the switch is perfect! I just enjoy the aesthetic of this console a lot that it's become my favorite switch to play on. I was just glad that I was able to snag one since a lot of Nintendo Switch consoles are almost impossible to find in stores and online. Highly recommend if you have the budget for a regular console! Have had no issues so far.",

I also never had a special edition console before either. I was going to skip this console even though a brand new Animal Crossing game was announced, but when they announced this Switch. I just couldn't pass this one up. The Animal Crossing game itself wasn't something that appeal to me either. It looks like it plays too much like Pocket Camp. It doesn't seem like it plays like your traditional Animal Crossing game, so I was going to just pass up on it. Now that I own the Switch. Hopefully I can get some more games for it besides Animal Crossing. That way It won't feel like a complete waste of money on purchasing it.Anyway, the system is adorable and I'm happy that I have it. I waited a day too late to pre-order it, so on release date. I had to get up early to hit my local Target. I went to my local Wal-Mart, but they was clueless as to what I was talking about. Even though I called two days earlier and they said they know of three they had in stock. My local GameStop said they'll have extras too, but that store is the store I go to as my last resort. I'm not a fan of GameStop (even though I pre-ordered New Horizons there.)My Wal-Mart is extremely ghetto. No good Customer service at all and workers got terrible attitudes and are impatient with their customers. I went home after being at Wal-Mart for a little over an hour waiting for them to open up their electronics section and my phone had died. When I got home, I called them to see if the electronics were open. Still no answer, so I gave up on Wal-Mart. I decided to call my local Target after I looked up what time they open. I called the first time which was no answer, so I waited a few minutes and called again. They finally picked up and told me they had quite a few systems after I asked them. When I went to my Target. It was only two people back in the electronics section and they were not looking for a Special Edition Animal Crossing Switch. I was the only one looking for it. I got my copy and headed home finally able to rest since I didn't sleep all night that previous night. I wouldn't be surprised if my local Target still have some in stock.Anyhow, Obviously the game doesn't come with the system. If it did, the system would be priced higher. Also people (like me for instance) don't want a digital copy of the game. I prefer a physical copy. Digital games depresses me, so it only make since for Nintendo to not bundle the game with the system. Let the people decide if they want a digitally, or a actual physical copy. It's been said by Nintendo as well as countless others that the game will not be included. You have to be living under a rock in order to miss that info. The system released Friday March 13, 2020. The game doesn't come out until tomorrow, which is Friday March 20, 2020. So I don't know why people thought the game was going to come bundled with the system and they both released at different times.The system is very pretty. I haven't used the dock yet though until I get a screen protector. I heard though that the Switch fits a bit more loosely in the dock to prevent the screen from getting scratched, which is awesome, but I still don't want to dock the Switch yet until I get a screen protector. I also will most likely be playing my Switch in handheld mode, so I will be getting a case for it. I saw a hard shell Animal Crossing case. It looks much sturdier and cuter than the one everyone got on the Switch's release. This Switch is just a thing of beauty, but now I'm broke lol.",

I tried to buy it in March but it quickly sold out everywhere and then the price sky-rocketed. I could not bring myself to pay what the resellers were asking, so I just waited and watched the price. In late September I saw the price started going down and considered buying from a reseller, I am glad I didn't. I was able to buy this at retail price from a game store, for some reason Amazon did not seem to be selling at retail price but a different retailers are. Anyone who wants this version of the Switch should get them while the price has improved.",

      "review": "What's NOT to love about the Switch? It has proven itself to be a solid gaming console. While CERTAINLY not as powerful as the PS5and Xbox Series X (It is not even as powerful as the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X),it holds its own in many aspects. It has a large library of 1st party hits and the 3rd party support is strong as well. Whether in docked mode for TVs or in handheld/tabletop mode for portable play.... Switch has you covered. The ONLY issue with this version of the Switch design that I have, is the flimsy kickstand in the back for tabletop play. You are MUCH better off buying a third party stand for this purpose. This is an issue that the upcoming (at the time of this review being written) OLED Switch will seemingly rectify. NOW all that aside, if you are a video game collector, I would STRONGLY suggest that you do not delay and pick this up NOW, while it is still at the normal retail price. Because once they run out of stock/Nintendo discontinues it...... the price will start to rise with 3rd party resellers/scalpers. I Believe that you will NOT be disappointed.",

DO NOT let scalpers steal money from you when you can use the extra money to buy a game or two.Now moving on to the switch itself. It is so much fun! I got Mario 3d all stars as my first game/games for mine I've been enjoying it so much. I heard from my friends who are also switch owners that joycon drift is a thing I will inevitably have to deal with since the controller has a defect of some kind which causes the joysticks to eventually drift and ruin gameplay. So a Pro controller is something that you may consider investing in which is what I plan to do as well. For that reason I have to remove a star off my rating. Other than that the console is really awesome and I truly recommend owning it but not for what the scalpers are asking for them. I recommend waiting like I did until more are in stock for the normal price of $300.",

And luckily I had enough but others may not and it makes me feel bad. It would\u2019ve been nice to pay the original price or at least make it more of an affordable price. Or not just bought it and sell it for more and let others have the actual chance of getting one in stores or online when it came out. If you have the money for this and if you\u2019re a big fan of animal crossing I would say that this is something to do but I wish this was for affordable for others who may be fans of animal crossing as well and don\u2019t have this much money to spare.",

There isn't much difference with the layout, or playing the games, but there are some nice playing features on Mario mainly choosing the character I play with. Other than that I love that the switch is smaller and doesn't take up that much space, it charges super fast, don't need the disc - those should've went out years ago, I have the yearly switch online membership to player older games which is cool not having to purchase each one. I've had my console about 1 month no complaints, and I love the colors of the animal crossing console. Happy customer !!!",

      "review": "CONS!1. They say you get a FREE 7 DAY TRIAL MEMBERSHIP. This is a complete scam. When you try to sign up it asks you to pick a membership which you assume starts AFTER the free trial! Nope you get charged instantly, and you get no trial! Classic bait and switch.2. Joy Con Drift! After a few months your controllers will drift all over on their own. Class action lawsuit already underway for this.3. SLOW! It took 45 minutes to download Rocket League on this thing. I have a super fast connection and would take only a couple minutes on a laptop.4. Bad Controls! I played Mario 35 (which I can only play for 2 days before they delete it off my device! WTF!) And having played thousands of hours on Mario on previous gen consoles this one has the button locations set in very weird spots. (I can probably remap the buttons, but why are they so unconventional for the defaults.5. It's EXPENSIVE! Nintendo has for years created artificial shortages of their products to create hype which then creates strong sales for them, so they constantly do this in waves which means when in stock the \"flippers\" stock up on them and gouge you on prices when Nintendo does their fake shortage thing.6. It's OLD! This console had specs when new 5 or 6 years ago. The graphics are horrible when compared to the new Playstation and Xbox.7. Nintendo hates it's customers. Nintendo has sued people for streaming and posting video gameplay. And for years charged YouTubers to show their content. Talk about greed!PROS1. Good resale value",
