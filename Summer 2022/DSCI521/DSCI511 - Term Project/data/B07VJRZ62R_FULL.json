      "review": "Everything about the physical device, i feel like is pretty well made. Good set up, some minor future issues that are mitigated by screen protectors and similar. Several easy to work with ways to play it, kinda fun in its novelties on its build.My issue?1) games are ridiculously expensive. So many are over priced.2) Online play required by Nintendo for a not good service is poor. Especially for things like minecraft.3) Where are any older games. The games that Nintendo has no need to keep out of the store. The old pokemon, Zelda games, or any games really. Like, great you are putting witcher 3 on there...But not Orignal Zelda and Ocherina of time?Physical? Great! Nintendo online and games? Bad. 1 or 2 games does not make the switch worth buying. PC has better prices, easier to work with, and you can play almost any game out there.",

      "title": "Love the Switch - A Casual Gamer's Best Console",
      "review": "This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)).So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while.I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings.So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime).Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.",

      "title": "(New) Nintendo Switch HAC-001(-01)",
      "review": "This revised model of the Switch comes with a number of features that I honestly can't fully appreciate as someone who didn't own the previous model. The big thing that drew me in was the extended battery life, even though so far I haven't played much in handheld mode and not at all in tabletop, but they use the same amount of battery either way I would imagine. The reason I'm giving this system five stars probably say more about how good it is than anything else. But I pretty much expected as much. I'm sure by now you can go online and find more detailed reviews for the gaming system, but in case you're wondering here, this one comes with the system, two gray joycons, two attachments to turn each joycon into its own controller, a base to connect both joycons into the formation of a singular controller, the required cables, and the Switch dock. So you'll probably want to buy a few things alongside this such as an SD card for reasonable storage space, a pro controller for a more standard controller experience, maybe a dock sleeve to prevent the possibility of scratching the screen from insertion and ejection of the system, an online pass if you plan to play any games with online features... just basically a lot of things that would be nice if they came with the system itself. This will inflate the price further, but the thing here is that this is going to replace the old models of the Switch and simply make this the main one manufactured now. So... basically, if you want a cheaper Switch you'll want to get a Switch Lite and this one will still cost about 300 bucks like the 2.5+ year-old original variant still costs. That is, unless you want to go used. I'm only bringing up these points because while this is a great system, I do think you should be aware of what is likely to happen with prices and availability going forward and plan accordingly. Once I realize a Switch was still going to cost the same if I wanted the ability to do on and off TV play I decided I might as well just hop on board with this newer variant. I'd recommend you do the same as it has had tweaks to make it just a slightly better version all around than the previous model. Otherwise, if price is a concern, wait for the Switch Lite and see how it tickles your fancy. Also, here's tip. If you want to turn the system off as opposed to leaving it in sleep mode, simply hold down the power button on the system for a few seconds and then a menu will appear with the option to restart or shut down. Also note that you cannot play on the TV off of the Switch's battery power. The dock needs to be plugged in for the dock to function. I hope something in here was helpful.",

      "title": "Elegant compromise between handheld and console",
      "review": "In terms of raw horsepower (CPU, graphics, whatever) the Nintendo Switch is far behind the current generation of consoles like the XBox One.But, the Switch is a unique device.As a handheld, it is quite powerful (the latest iteration nearly doubles the handheld's battery life, addressing the Switch's greatest weakness).This allows you to play the same game on your TV and keep playing it as you take it out with you --- a unique ability.Most importantly, there is a staggering array of software available for it.Software is what makes or breaks a console, no matter how good it is.For example the Zelda game \"Breath of the Wild\" is a visual stunner with a huge open world.And this is the first portable system that has the full version of Skyrim available for it (the reason I bought it --- a high quality port of Skyrim with the 3 add-on packs).Nintendo has also done high quality ports of other gems from older consoles such as \"Mario Kart 8\" as well as a lot of new titles such as \"Super Smash Brothers Ultimate\" or \"Luigi's Mansion 3\".In addition,their digital store has a lot of quality indie games such as Stardew Valley.Also, if you purchase the Nintendo Switch Online membership ($20/year) Nintendo also gives you a large selection of NES and SNES classic games.The membership is worthwhile for that alone.Basically, because Nintendo is ONLY selling the Switch as a current console (the 3DS is on its way out), all of their best software goes to the one console.And that gives developers strong incentives to bring their best titles over as well.If you want a wide variety of games, the Switch is a good choice.If you want THE best console graphics or performance, obviously the Switch isn't for you.",

      "review": "I don\u2019t use this the way that Nintendo advertises; predominantly hand held.I have the Skull & Company Grip Case attached at all times and only play in handheld mode.The Switch Lite is too small and doesn\u2019t have the HD rumble like this one has.This model is the better one with the longest battery life currently available.This is not designed with comfort in mind for handheld play sessions so the Lite may be a better option if comfort is important.If you get hand cramps like I do, I highly recommend the Skull & Company grip case.They also have a great travel case that you can get with it that has plenty of space for the switch with case and joycons attached and space for games, a power adapter and power bank.It is very good quality and the Switch is dockable with the grip case attached.The switch itself has a much faster, more user friendly, prettier, less congested graphics user interface than all of Nintendo\u2019s previous consoles.It has a solid state drive for saving and downloading some games, and is expandable with the purchase of Micro SD cards for additional space.The online store is easy to use and probably the best Nintendo has ever had.Easy to sort by price, genre, developer.It is fast and easy to use and you can sort for free games and demos too.The load time between starting games and between cut scenes in game is very quick on hard drive, sd card, and game cartridge.Much quicker than nintendo\u2019s previous consoles.I haven\u2019t played with the joy cons detached so I can\u2019t comment on how responsive the joycons are to movement and player interaction when joycons are detached.The HD rumble is more subtle than on PS4 and XBox but some games have used it very well.Mario Odyssey for example has done a great job of blending the environments in some levels to match well with the rumble feedback; its hard to explain, but this feels like the next step in controller evolution and PS5 and NextBox will be adopting a similar tech so more developers should get on board with HD Rumble in future games, hopefully.The switch buttons have a nice click and feel like they will last, much like most of Nintendo\u2019s products but the stick feels a little looser than the PS4.I would like Nintendo to tighten that up for the Pro version.Overall, this is decades of Nintendo engineering in the making which has resulted in, arguably their best console to date.It is going to shatter console sales records for good reason.I highly recommend this version of the Switch for the battery life, larger screen and hd rumble, but you may want to get a comfort grip if you will be using it predominantly as a handheld.I no longer play on my 3DS because this is a much better player experience.",

The drift in both is so bad that you can\u2019t make right turns playing Mario Kart. I checked the calibration and followed a number of online tutorials for things to try, but to no avail. Come to find out, there is a class action lawsuit against Nintendo for this very problem. Apparently the solution is to send the controllers to Nintendo and wait a month for them to diagnose and maybe repair them. This is probably why I haven\u2019t thought about the brand Nintendo for almost 20 years since I last owned any of their products. I\u2019ve owned virtually every gaming console created and never once had this issue with any other controllers. If you are so desperate to play outdated video games with Nintendo level quality that enduring this garbage is worth it to you, then more power to you. I\u2019m fine dumping this console in the trash and going back to forgetting Nintendo even exists for the next 20 years. I\u2019ll stick to Xbox.",

      "review": "This is, strangely enough, the first portable system I have ever bought in my 30+ years of gaming. I\u2019ve actually bought 2 Switches so far. The first one was a Christmas present for my son who I was trying to ease into video games. He loves it. After him having it for a year and me occasionally playing it to help him through areas where my greater experience with games could help get through certain areas, I was tempted to get one for myself to play when I had long periods of downtime at work. When Witcher 3 came out for the switch, I bought another one for me and have been playing it a few times per week since.My experience with the console is pretty much strictly in the handheld mode. I bought a Satisfye grip and case for my switch which allows me to hold the system more comfortably than I would without it. Holding the standard system and playing for more that 20 minutes or so causes my hands to cramp. The small joycons are just too small for adult male hands to use for long without some discomfort. I\u2019m fine with that since the small size makes the system easier for kids, like my son, to use. A regular controller can be a bit bulky for a grade school age kid to use well. With the case and grip, this system is perfect for me to throw into my vehicle at work and forget about it until things slow down when I\u2019m waiting for a call. Then I can break it out and pass the time in style.All in all, I have no complaints about the system, my son loves it and uses it constantly. I like it for its portable nature and surprising computing power. It is the first portable system I\u2019ve experienced that didn\u2019t feel like a downgrade or gimmick. The Switch instead feels like a true portable version of a larger console like PS4 or XB1. I still play on my PS4 far more than I do the Switch, but I can\u2019t take that system to work and play in the office or car. If you have young kids, or a desire to game on the go with something better than your phone, then it\u2019s hard to go wrong with the switch.",

      "review": "I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I\u2019ve spent some time with it (more than I\u2019d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review.The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it\u2019s main pro being that it\u2019s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can\u2019t bring my big honkin\u2019 PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it\u2019s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and thenwhen I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly \u201cSwitch\u201d to the Switch and continue my game.There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo\u2019s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they\u2019re splattering paint all over each other.However the Switch also has its cons. Let\u2019s start with Nintendo\u2019s \u201cE-Shop\u201d. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games.Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony\u2019s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly.All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It\u2019s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it\u2019s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games.5/5 Stars",

      "review": "I'm suppose to love the Switch, but I don't.I think it's a bad deal overall.1) Nintendo Online doesn't offer much compared to the Wii virtual console days.There's no Metroid games from the GC/Wii/Advance era.Nearly all the games for the switch look like something from the 90's when flash games were popular. But the games are priced as if they're made out of gold.2) The frame rate on this console is poor. Yeah, some games reach a respectable 30fps, but I'd say most games fall below that.3) The dock is very woobly, it doesn't lock in, and it's very easy to scratch up the screen.4) There is no wired connection out of the box.Why should I have to buy an adapter for that?If you play online seriously, you use a wired connection.5) Here's what really bugs me.There's no web browser on this thing.No web browser for a mobile device? Are you kidding me?This also leads to bizarre consequences.Since there's no reviews on the Nintendo store, you're forced to go to third party sites for reviews... but you can't, because there's no web browser.LMAO! And I had to create my nintendo account on a PC!ROFL!Conclusion:I'll stick with the PC, Xbox and Playstation.If these issues ever get resolved, I'll reconsider.It's an interesting design, but it's all hype - little value.$300 is way overboard for this gimmicky soy toy.",

Sometimes, I don\u2019t have to put it on the dock to charge for 5 or 6 days, assuming I\u2019m playing 30 minutes here and there. I highly recommend this system.",

With the jump to an Nvidia GPU, not only does the bar for graphics get bumped up significantly from what Nintendo has released recently, it also allows third-party title developers the ability to bring their fun games to Nintendo for releases.Let's state that this isn't as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but still has very good graphics. Not only that, but being able to undock it and play it like a handheld is an awesome feature. Switch Online, a service needed for online gaming, also includes NES and SNES titles you can play for free (included in the price really). My ONE issue, is that chat is needed through an external app. If this is done so the playing experience online requires less bandwidth in the rooms and therefore is smoother on the servers, than it makes sense. Otherwise, seems a bit annoying to have to need another device for it.",

      "review": "This review is targeted at newcomers so for veterans of Nintendo products, not much new information here! As for everyone else looking at this gaming system wondering if its right for them, I'll do my best to explain what this model in particular brings to the table. In my particular case a: \"Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy\u2011Con - HAC-001(-01)\"Introduction to the system/What is a Nintendo Switch?:The Nintendo Switch is a \"hybrid system\". Lets break it down to its core do understand what people mean by \"hybrid system\", lets start with what is basically a gaming tablet with a plastic screen and a multi-touch-touchscreen. This is the \"Switch itself\" so to speak. For a \"console\", it is EXTREMELY thin in comparison to a PS4 or Xbox One for example. This also means it takes significantly less energy to run. The internal cooling fan is also significantly quieter than either of the prior two other consoles mentioned.That multi-touch-touchscreen allows for certain mobile games like Muse Dash, VOEZ, Deemo, and many others to be ported to the Switch without compromising their touch screen gimmicks from their mobile phone counterparts. Despite this, many of them do have support for button controls. Many Switch games gives you options on how you want to play and this is a running theme with the Switch.Now for the controllers which are \"hybrid controllers\" in a way. For those of you who used the Nintendo Wii, these \"Joy Cons\" share and improved upon the motion controls from the Wii days, except in addition to the motion controls, Nintendo also made the actual button layout resemble a regular controller like the button layout found on a Xbox One controller for example. Not that weird button layout on the Wii for example. This means both the Wii crowd can assimilate into this new generation of Nintendo, along side the core gamers who would prefer a more \"traditional\" controller button set up.Normally a player would use both Joy Cons together as a pair, whether that be attached to the Switch Tablet itself to be played on the go like a 3DS (be it much longer than a 3DS), at home and connected to a plastic grip that gives you those controller \"thighs\" to make it easier to hold and to make it feel more like a more traditional controller even more. You can even use the Joy Cons without them being attached to anything like the Wiimote and Numchuck, but without that annoying wire in between your controllers. This \"detached\" controller style option with the Joy Cons allows you to play in positions otherwise impossible with a more \"static\" controller. For example, you can play with one arm behind your head while the other arm is resting on your stomach as you play from your bed or couch.These Joy Cons also have two buttons on the plastic rails that connect them to the Switch Tablet piece. These buttons are functional and you can actually use just a single Joy Con per player in certain supported games.Key word \"supported games\". This is where the main issue with the Nintendo Switch lies, Nintendo laid the foundation for developers to have the best tools at their deposal but not all of them use them. Some developers have games that cost less overall on the Switch than their original releases on other systems, or from mobile with mobile's atrocious micro-transactions , meanwhile there's other developers that neither have the full game on the physical game cartridges while having the audacity to be more expensive on the Switch. But again, its ALL developer based. Research the game developers in question to see if you're getting the best value for buying their ports (or original) releases on the Nintendo Switch.Oh right, this gaming system uses cartridges. Don't worry, they're not those huge ones from the Nintendo 64 days! They're more Nintendo 3DS sized if anything. If the developer you choose did it properly, a entire game can fit on these cartridges. This means you can play those properly done physical releases immediately without any additional downloads. But again, developer based. Some of them DO only \"partially\" have the game on the Switch Cartridge(s). Do your research.Now to talk about the Dock that connects the Switch Tablet to a TV.If you open up the back side of the Dock, there should be two slits near the bottom of the Dock. The Switch Tablet has two air vents that when \"docked\" should be right up against those vents. Please try not to block off those vents so the Switch Tablet as a easier time cooling itself off while you (and others) play in \"TV Mode\". The Switch Tablet also has a air-vent on the top. So keep that area of the Switch Tablet clear as well.This particular model of the Nintendo Switch, model number \"HAC-001(-01)\", is different from day one Nintendo Switch systems in the sense that Switches with the model number \"HAC-001(-01)\" have better battery life. For example, day one Switches would run really graphically/resource intensive games for about 2 hours 30 minutes (or 2.5 hours) minimum. Whereas this new \"HAC-001(-01)\" numbered Switch(es) can run those games for up to 4.5 hours minimum in \"handheld mode\". The way these \"new Switches\" accomplish this is by having a more efficient component in the inside of the Tablet piece. This also means these new Switches are more energy efficient and less prone to overheating than the day one models. So this is even helpful for people who would use this gaming system for TV use.If you don't have a Switch yet, I recommend this model for its versatility. You never know when you'll change your mind on \"how\" you want to play. I used to use it mostly in TV mode but eventually started using it more and more while outside in general. For example, on the bus, while waiting for something to start whether it be a class, jury duty, meeting, you name it. The Nintendo Switch will make that wait all the less painful. Waiting to be called or dismissed for jury duty especially.Oh, I almost forgot! You CAN use power banks with the Nintendo Switch! The minimum power requirements for a power bank to work with a Nintendo Switch is 5 Volts, and 2.4 Amps. The cable you use to plug the Switch Tablet with a power bank can be found bundled with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Charging Grip. Both of those products come with the USB cable required to use a Nintendo Switch with a power bank. So even if you manage to drain this new Switch's battery life on a long trip, bring a battery bank and you can extend its battery life even further. But again, this mostly won't be needed unless you're on a air ride for over 7 hours or so. Anything less than that, if you're smart about it, you can get away with just the Switch's battery life.Speaking of battery life, the Joy Cons each have a estimated battery life of 20 hours each. Let me repeat that, 20 hours. That brings its competition's controllers to shame!So if you keep your Joy Cons charged overnight (they charge when connected to the Switch Tablet while the Tablet is charging in either the Dock or via battery bank), they ain't going to die unless you deliberately go out of your way not to charge them at least once a week.When their batteries are completely dead, both the Switch Tablet and one pair of Joy Cons takes about 3 hours to fully charge everything. So if you're able to, put the Switch Tablet with the pair of Joy Cons connected to it, and leave the three of them in the Dock overnight to keep everything nice and charged for tomorrows challenges.Get creative, once you get used to the options the Nintendo Switch offers, going to anything else, you'll realize that you'd taken for granted with the Nintendo Switch! In my particular case, using the two Joy Cons in each hand unconnected. I can't do that with a keyboard and mouse! So get your Joy Cons, get them in a position that works for you, get cozy on your couch, bed, etc. and have some fun with your game(s) of choice!Just keep in mind it is a GAMING SYSTEM FIRST, and the \"entertainment media center\" SECOND. So as of January 15th, 2020 don't expect things like Netflix to be on this machine. If you treat it as a DEDICATED gaming system, you're in for one hell of a ride!Just don't forget your screen protector since the Switch Tablet's screen is made of plastic!If you don't want to go through all of them, get this one:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XDWBPMZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1It should serve most peoples' needs. Its durable, cheap, anti-glare, self heals from minor scratches, etc. Its the most value for the price I've found from searching through all of what Amazon has as far as Switch Tablet screen protectors go.As far as the \"system itself\" goes, this is pretty much all of the information that you'd need. Everything else is developer centered, game wise. Do your research, and think very carefully which developers will give you the best bang for your buck!",

      "review": "I got this Gray version of the Nintendo Switch after a few months of hunting for retail price $299. There's a couple of websites out there that will notify you of in-stock. I happened to be able to grab it off of Amazon, but GameStop, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc, also have them as well. With it being in stock is rare, so you just have to look and be patient! Plan a few months ahead for birthday / xmas gifts so you have time to wait for a retail priced stock is in. Enough about the INSANE price gouging....I am very pleased with the Switch and am very happy with it. I have played on it for a week so far and everything is working fine and dandy, as it should. One gripe is that the storage capacity is small so only a few games can be played at a time, but with a micro SD card, possibilities are endless. I ordered one of those, and expect it soon so I can expand my downloaded game collection. I've enjoyed the Switch so much I'm getting some additional joycons and a grip and a charging station. I'm going to continue looking for accessories. Maybe a case I also had to get a TV adapter because my old TV only has one HDMI port, so I had to RCA to HDMI it up in order to not unplug and replug my Roku every time I want a bigger screen. How that goes is yet to be determined.I'm still figuring out how the dock station works (TV debacle), but for the most part - no complaints! I haven't played it with more than one person yet, but I'm positive that runs smoothly as well!",

I never owned the previous model but I can tell you that I played in handheld mode mostly from 11:30 am to 4:30 pm with the exception of lunch, and I played 'til about 4 pm before I got the low battery warning. I watched a Youtube video that also showed that the colors on the screen are more accurate and the cooling system has been improved. So if you're wanting to play Witcher 3 on here, I recommend getting this one, as that power hungry game might warp the chassis from overheating. On top of that they are the same price right now, so I don't think anyone should get the old model until the price goes down.",

      "review": "On paper this is such a slick device, and combined with great Nintendo titles this was something I was excited for. BUT this system just isn't there yet. Right now I'm dealing with input lag that goes beyond controller or title specific issues. Right from the get go, setting it up (while in portable mode) felt odd. The touch screen and the attached joy-cons felt a bit slow. The input lag was the same speed as my PS4 with my TVs game mode OFF. Not a huge deal for many who will play most casual games, but annoying enough for me that titles like Cuphead and Enter the Gungeon are hindered. I do wonder if the newer portable only version doesn't have these issues, but I'm mainly interested in this as a home console.And it's online component? They still haven't caught up with Xbox Live from the 360 generation. Not a huge problem with Discord around, but still.Lot's of pluses for this system for sure, but this is mainly a message to people to try out the system first and decide for yourself if the input lag is bad enough to ruin your experience. A lot of people are very satisfied and don't even notice. I can see this not being a problem in games like Pokemon, or Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. I've been playing \"The Touryst\", charming, relaxing, and a nice change of pace from what I usually play.",

I love playing video games and I own an Xbox and PS4, so I figure at some point it was time to complete the trifecta. While I\u2019m more of an Xbox person, I will say I am very impressed by the Switch. It is a very simple console, but genius in of itself. I\u2019ve had some Nintendo gaming devices here and there. A SNES back in the day, but mostly their portable ones from the Gameboy to the Advanced to the DS and 3DS. The Switch combines that of a home console and a portable gaming device and for that I love it. I can put it in the dock and play it on my TV. I can play it handheld which will be great for road trips or maybe just wanting to play anywhere. This was a brilliant move by Nintendo and it makes the Switch really stand on its own.Now what I\u2019d say my favorite thing about the console is it\u2019s simplicity. This device is made for one thing only and that is for playing video games. The console is both modern and old school at the same time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who really likes Nintendo and their games.",

My kids have to ask me for \u201cmore time\u201d when they\u2019ve hit a daily limit (which is customizable for the day of the week). It\u2019s very much like a simpler, more reliable version of Apple\u2019s Screen Time feature on iPhones. Of course, you can also unlock more time on the switch itself using a pin code.It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Nintendo did a great job with the \u201cuser assisted driving\u201d feature on Mario Kart that helps young kids and inexperienced gamers be competitive.

      "review": "So like the title says, any issue you have with the console or anything has to go through Nintendo. when I first got the system everything seemed to work fine. But after some gameplay I noticed that sometimes when i hit a button or move a joystick it doesn't always work. I chalked it up as user error and moved on. but now the problem is getting worse. so I go through the necessary steps to talk to Nintendo about getting a new one and they tell me all they can do is try to repair the joycon. And for reference I bought this system less than 2 months ago. so my brand new system doesn't even get brand new joycons its going to have rebuilt or refurbished. All in all very annoyed at the fact that i could have just bought a refurbished system and it would have been pretty much the same thing.",

      "review": "Awesome Console I get to run many games I've never gotten to play before, here's a few things:The screen and around it get items or \"spots\" Items and spots as it the tiny crack between the screen and the rest of the console, same goes with the speakers but you could use a toothpick or something small.The spots that I talk about look like if water or any other liquid had dried on the screen even though I never drink n play and they usually can be removed with ease(by rubbing) however I've had to use the backing of one of my rainbow pins to break it down so it could be scraped off with my fingernail. Thankfully it didn't scratch up the screen.Quality, certain games that are usually meant for quality look absolute garbage on switch(dbd, subnautica/below zero, etc). this usually can be fixed if you set it up on TV and up the quality or toggle with the settings however if you're on the go and wanna enjoy the game it'll be rather difficult. The Battery is still golden after a long time use! Pricing; when this console was bought it was 240-300 now its way more? This is a scam Nintendo!If anyone is looking for something like this just invest your money elsewhere like maybe the switch lite or one of the DS's. It's not worth it.",

      "review": "First of all, I wanna say that although Amazon may have some date when they say it will be in stock or some date when they say it\u2019ll be delivered, just know that it may be earlier than anticipated. I ordered mine thinking it wasn\u2019t gonna be here untilaround June 4th, so about 3 weeks to a month after I ordered the switch, but fortunately, it came 2 weeks earlier! Apparently, I\u2019m far from the only one who has experienced this, and a number of people have gotten their switch earlier than expected, so don\u2019t look at the date thinking that\u2019s when you\u2019re gonna get it, \u2018cause you may just get a nice surprise like a number of customers did. Yes, there are some stock issues with the switch at the moment as well as some production issues, but they are not as bad as they\u2019re made out to be, so if you are thinking about getting the switch, go ahead and pull the trigger! Also, DO NOT BUY FRON SCALPERS. As some other people have mentioned, they will buy a switch and then sell it for a greater price than needed in order to make a profit, and although it may be tempting to buy from them so you can get it sooner, it is so not worth paying the extra money when the situation is actually better than amazon makes it out to be. Don\u2019t do yourself a disservice and fall into the instant gratification trap. Be willing to wait a little bit longer for your switch. YOU\u2019LL BE GLAD YOU DID.",

Everything was in the box and it looked brand new.At first I didn\u2019t have enough to buy any physical games so I bought some games for sale on the E shop. And it worked great! But only till after the return date passed did I realize, the game card reader was broken! When I first played one of the games it seemed to work fine. But later when I removed the game and I inserted it again, it told me it couldn\u2019t read the game card. Easy enough, just restarting the switch made it read. But now months have past and the only game card it seems to read is animal crossing. All my other games just wont read. Even a brand new copy of Minecraft. Since I believe I still have warranty, I wanted to contact Nintendo for repairs but it\u2019s been shut down due to COVID. I hope I can get this fix. I\u2019m very disappointed.",

That being said Mums Collectibles & Stuff is by far the cheapest I have seen a new switch go for on amazon, ebay or a number of other websites.On top of all of this one I bought the item from them they had it ready and shipped the next day as I did buy it rather late at night. With an estimated arrival time of 2 weeks I actually received it a week early which I give my thanks to UPS. When I opened the package I found they took the time to make sure that the switch was secure and safe with two layers of massive bubble wrap which was just extra enjoyment.All in all they are the cheapest, quickest and most reliable source to get a switch right now.",

Even though it was overpriced, I understand that it is due to low supply due to the pandemic so I am not that upset about it as the console has been working perfectly and came with everything advertised. The only problems I ran into were low memory and short battery life on the device but those were easily fixed. The seller was also very helpful and the switch arrived much earlier than expected and on my birthday, coincidentally. Definitely worth its original price ($299) and even though the rise in price is disappointing and definitely pricey, I would argue that its also somewhat worth it. Playing on this is a good way to spend lockdown, so I don't regret making this purchase.",

I'm returning it today due to there not being any way to lift the ban (I contacted Nintendo support via phone and they said there's nothing they can do.) I advise anyone that is buying used consoles to be wary of the seller. The only thing that was noted in description was that it wouldn't come in it's original packaging, nothing about it being a permanently banned console that restricts you from online features. It's a clear scam due to the price it was sold for. Now if it were $100 or something that made sense (with proper description) then I would've been able to take my losses and not leave a review like this.This review doesn't reflect my opinion on Nintendo at all, my star rating is strictly based on my buying experience from CellularStream.",

It\u2019s no where near as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox but the fact that I can take my games on a road trip or play it at home is pretty awesome and convenient for gamers. The Joy-Cons do get loose however over time and will slide off without having to press the release button so I would recommend getting a grip or a case like the picture shown above. Another thing I wan to mention is the joy con drift, which can get really annoying at times. Having to calibrate them in the settings menu every other minute can be really annoying and for others, ruin the experience. I usually use a pro controller while playing on docked mode and I don\u2019t run into any issues but the problem persists when I\u2019m playing on table top or handheld. Besides the minor inconvenience here and there, I think the Nintendo Switch is great, especially with third party games like Skyrim or the Witcher 3 being ported over to the Switch. It\u2019s a great little console.",

      "review": "I received a Switch that is unable to connect to the TV, so, it's pretty much just a more expensive Switch Lite.After an insane amount of troubleshooting, I was finally told by Nintendo that the product was defective.Nintendo wanted me to ship it in for repairs, THE DAY AFTER I BOUGHT IT.So instead of offering me an exchange, they want me to send in my BRAND NEW SWITCH for repairs.Kind of ridiculous if you ask me, they should have replaced my Switch no questions asked.On top of that, Amazon is not offering exchanges either. I am very disappointed that neither company has a reasonable solution for defective Switches. I will be returning this Switch, and I can tell you, it definitely wasn't worth the headache trying to get my hands on it.",

      "review": "When I was little I used to be able to spend all day playing games. Of course as I got older, my amount of free time decreased exponentially. If, like me, you need to balance your job and college life but still want to play games, this console is a really great choice. It's loaded with tons of pick-up-and-play games that are great for quick 30 minute sessions. The handheld mode makes it really accessible and portable, and the new model has a great battery life. My only big complaint is that the controllers when in handheld mode don't always feel securely attached to the sides of the console. There is a small amount of wiggle if you move the console that is not really enough to bog down the experience, but is still noticeable enough to feel sort of cheap. Overall though this is a great console for a busy young adult still trying to find time for their favorite hobby and I highly reccomend it if you're interested.",

Since I'm neither a parent nor do I need to be controlled, I disable restrictions and play-time limit so it doesn't actually interfere when I'm playing, but it is a bit sobering to see that yesterday I played for 6 hrs and 40 min.Also, if you set the play-time limit to 0 min everyday, the console will prompt you to disable Parental Control via a PIN. This could come in very handy if you have a sibling or roommate who likes to steal your Switch.I would also recommend getting a screen cover, either plastic or glass. I have a glass one that adheres like a second screen and haven't had any trouble yet, but then again I've only had it for 8 days and treat it very carefully.Overall, a great product, and worth every penny!",

Upon delivery, one joycon controller was broken ( no peg to lock it in and not even holding a charge) the screen is also scratched, as well the back of it, and it's missing the controller attachment for the joycons. It's like it wasn't even checked before it was sent.Tldr; switch came with a completely broken joycon, scratches on screen and back(not a super huge deal, just annoyed because the lable of like new), and it's missing the controller for the joycons.Edit: changed to 4 stars. Fast reply and a refund which is enough to replace the missing/damageditems.",

      "review": "A Nintendo Switch with extended battery life? What's not to love? It's a no-brainer! Nintendo is always at the forefront of console innovation and they didn't miss a beat with the Switch. Want to play a game on your tv like a traditional console? Drop the Switch into the dock and game on in 1080p HD. Need to hit the road? Slide the Switch out of the dock and continue your gaming on the go in brilliant 720p HD. And I haven't even gotten into the built-in option for multiplayer gaming with the removable controllers. Like I said, cutting edge console innovation from Nintendo! Come for the innovative console, stay for the myriad of both cutting edge and nostalgia-inducing first party titles from Nintendo. Not into Mario and Link games? How about the largest library of quality Indie games and old-school games? No matter how you look at it, the Switch is where it's at!",

The controllers were very awkward to use individually, no instructions for purpose of strap clip on, and first run of Mario party the game was incredibly frustrating with the movement of each character (was like the stick on the controller was out of sync as we couldn\u2019t get the character to walk straight ) the menus you couldn\u2019t scroll left or right (using up cycled through each area) and on everytime it said use a specific button on screen and highlighted that button , it was another button to complete an action \u2026 registering for Nintendo online was annoying and paying .50c to register really? Overall never again with the switch , poorly designed, poorly thought after games, way to many menus and storylines before game play, way to many ways to get frustrated before even enjoying a game\u2026 wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone yet alone a younger gamer\u2026 the old Wii was leaps and bounds easier and more enjoyable \u2026 the only positive was the portability however even that after 10 mins and downloading a new game was just ok, Xbox, PS5 with ease of controls and quickness to playing make them far superior even if not in the same console class\u2026",

      "review": "The Nintendo Switch is a by for that most convenient and versatile console on the market. And If you're reading this during the epidemic you may have to wait a little while to get one sadly.Let's make this simple:Pros:It can be used as a handheld for personal/travel and used in Dock mode (Like a standard console) seamlessly. (Note: This does not apply to the Switch Lite which is \"handheld\" only)Fun for kids and adults.Plenty of games on the online store.All the Nintendo classics you love. (Mario, Mario Cart, Zelda, etc...)More high-quality controller options than any other system.Cons:Official Nintendo controllers (Joycons or pro controller) are expensive.Joycons can be a little small when sharingOnline store. (Hard to find quality titles sometimes)Not the best online experience. (But it is only $20 for the year)Battery Life could be longer (Depending on model)A surprising thing has happened. I have a Playstation 4, XboxOne, and a PC. Yet somehow the Nintendo Switch has become the default console to play on. In fact, I found that I'm often time annoyed when a game I want to play isn't available for the machine.The ease of transportation is the leading factor here. You can play console-quality titles in bed, on the toilette (let's be honest, you're on your phone so why not?), in the back of a Uber/Cab/Plane, or while the family is watching TV. Also, the suspend function is nearly flawless allowing you to just hit the power button to pause the action and continue right where you left off for most games. (This doesn't work for online play of course)The graphics are not the best. This is after all the weakest of the three main systems and you'd never compare this to the PC. However; in order to keep this at an affordable price point cuts had to be made somewhere.If you have a family or are on the go this is likely the system for you. The only thing I'll say is this isn't the best system for sports games. So if that's your thing you may want to skip it, also the online play isn't the best as you have to use things like \"friend codes\" and gaining friends isn't so easy.last if you want to live a long full life stay away from ANIMAL CROSSING... you will seriously forget that you have to live a real-life! lol",

      "title": "An Absolute Game Changer",
      "review": "I was given the Nintendo Switch as a gift 3 years ago. Having grown up with every Nintendo console since the classic NES, it was the last console to be added to the collection. At first I thought, as an adult with responsibilities, I might be too busy to sit down and play video games like the good old days. However, the Nintendo Switch has been an absolute game changer in the video game world. The console switches easily between handheld mode or docked mode, making it a breeze to go portable or be docked back to the TV. If you\u2019re a Nintendo fan like I am, you might feel unsure about the controls, especially since this is the debut of the Joy-Con, but the controls still feel natural and intuitive when using the Joy-Cons in their various play modes. I\u2019ve also noticed that the user interface in both the system menus and in the games, are simple enough to accommodate players of all ages, which means no one gets left out during family game night. One negative is the paid membership required to access online capabilities for many games. Even if you\u2019re connected to the Wi-Fi that you probably already pay for, a yearly subscription for family members to be able to play together online from afar is $34.99. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this game console to both kids and the casual adult gamers with responsibilities, like myself. The graphics, portability, and usability will keep you fully immersed in the game and experience.",

      "review": "For details as to how this item received the given rating, see below:Nintendo did an awesome job in creating a mobile device that connects to a television or other HDMI output. Compared to other systems, the online membership is far less inexpensive, however it does lack additional incentives (comparing to a PlayStation + subscription). It has many games available to download (or can be purchased via physical media). The catalog is extensive and with the online subscription you can get some retro gaming action!The ability to take this with you anywhere, have games downloaded, and be able to hook up to any video output is awesome! Nintendo nailed it with this system. The controls are a bit small (at least for adults), but this can be fixed with the Joy Con comfort grips or via 3rd party accessories.Pros:Portable.Long battery life.Extensive library of games.Docking station charges unit/controllers and allows external output.Easy to use and setup.Cons:Not backwards compatible with existing/owned titles.At this moment, unable to previous generation games for the Switch (unless ported over specific to Switch or via retro emulator for NES/SNES, but not for Wii U, 3DS, etc).Packaging had some plastic covers/wrappers.*Note, there are two ratings applied to the reviewed item. \"Product rating\" and \"Packaging rating\". The actual product will not be impacted by the packaging as these are two separate ratings.In regards to packaging, the following are contributing factors against the \"Packaging rating\":In an effort to globally reduce and promote less usage of plastic, any usage of plastic or non-environmentally safe packaging/products/material will be marked negatively.Single use items that do not biodegrade or cannot be easily recycled (see point above on plastics).The packaging rating is being introduced to help drive a shift to more sustainable and environmentally friendly resources.Visit examinators.com for more reviews!",

      "review": "The switch and accessories are cheaply made. My first issue with the the system was the controls.... The controllers are insanely expensive and luckily my wife bought me a extra set of controls for my Christmas present when she bought the switch because within a couple months two of the 4 controllers stopped working. Looked it up and apparently alot of people were having this issue. But was deploying and really wasnt to worried about it. So got back from my deployment and tried to playmy switch on the dock and guess what that decided it wasn't going to work either, looked this up... Guess what alot of people had that same issue too. If I want to replace the dock and one set of controllers it would cost over half the price of the system. Every other system has expensive accessories but I can depend on them to work. But I do love the switch but hate the fact I can't use it on the TV to actually play games with my family which is half of the reason people buy this system... Other wise I would rather stick with my PlayStation for anything at home and only play my switch if I'm out of the house and have nothing to do.",

It also doesn't hurt my hands like the switch lite did after playing for a while. I think because the controls are a little bigger. The battery lasts a long time. I had to charge my switch lite 2-3 times to get the same play time out of it as this system.I play Mario Kart online for 2+ hours and still had 30% battery left. The next day I was able to get another 1.5 hours of Mario Kart off that last 30%. I ended up charging it at 16% because I didn't want to run the battery all the way down.This is the first Nintendo I've bought since the N64, and I'm glad I did. I'm having a lot of fun with it so far. I never liked any of the other systems (Game Cube, Wii, etc...) I did like the 3DS XL a lot, and this system replaced that one. I'm so glad it uses the older style game carts instead of discs. Makes me feel like I actually have a game again, like the N64, SNES, NES.",

      "review": "We have 6 kids who played on and loved the Xbox, only thing is I wanted more kid type games for them so we ended up buying a switch and then Immediately a second one for our other room because we loved it so much. Every day since they have rushed to get school done, so they can play on it. We homeschool. We love all the games, only thing we wished they had was Roblox for the switch as they love those games as well. Do wish they had a bigger selection of games and each game is pretty expensive but you can sometimes find better deals online on Nintendo\u2019s website. Make sure if you want digital to get a bigger memory card. Maybe one day they will have Roblox available. We also loved that it is super easy to travel with so we bought a case to protect them and took them to grandma\u2019s as she has nothing for the littler kids to do. What was even cooler is that you can set it up on its stand and play multiple player even without a TV screen which is amazing!!! So many cool things about it as you don\u2019t need internet to play either, it can be played solo or with others. Also love the dance 2020 game as the whole family gets up and dances together. The parental control blocks are also a bonus!!! Not to mention Xbox family is double the cost so a year of family on the switch is very affordable at about half cost. The size is also very compact and small. I\u2019ll share a pic as size comparison. Oh and we bought a screen protector as well as I was worried sliding it in and out of the console might scratch it. Hope this helps! Oh and the pic is of the same switch but different color joycons. The gray one is in the other room but I wanted to show you the compact size. So look for the blue and red gaming console next to clock. For size comparison our TV is a 65\u201d.",

Interestingly, it also changes the value of the bundle, for example the Animal Crossing colors sell for much higher than the gray, which is higher than the neon colors.- Resolution is nice- Pretty easy to understand and use- Great battery life (make sure to get the 2020 v2)- Modern ports (USB-C)- Software is good and pretty well-designed- Great selection of gamesCONS:- Apparently keeping it docked can overheat the Switch, so some recommend purchasing an adapter that plugs in to the USB-C port instead of the dock it came with- Speed is a tad slow in opening games and gameplay- Joy-cons are quite non-ergonomic - mitigated a bit by the controller you can dock them in- Easily shows fingerprints/oils and scratches",

      "review": "I really wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to get a Nintendo Switch. But now I love the Switch! I\u2019m just getting into it in 2021. I was first a PC player and then just a Playstation player. I love the Switch\u2019s versatility going from handheld to docked mode. I play mine mainly docked on my 4k monitor. The stock joycons aren\u2019t that comfortable so I bought the Hori Split Pad controllers, and I use a Pro controller while docked. There\u2019s also the joycon drift issue but I haven\u2019t experienced that. The first party games on the Switch are unique from Playstation and Xbox. They give you game experiences that are unique to Nintendo. There are also good 3rd party games that have been brought to the Switch. Overall I\u2019ve been very impressed with the Switch and it\u2019s been the only console I\u2019ve played for the last 3-4 months. We\u2019ll just have to see if Nintendo brings on a revised Switch in the next year or so. I highly recommend the Switch!",

I had been waiting for the price to lower to the standard $299.99 MSRP and not be on preorder for days, and when I randomly checked one afternoon, this one (gray joycons) had restocked probably about 10 units. I noticed every once in a while they'll just put a couple of units out so you don't need to wait months to get yours. Just keep checking in to get the price that you want instead of paying an extra $50-$90 while they're in high demand. Overall, definitely recommend the console and patience to save some money!",
