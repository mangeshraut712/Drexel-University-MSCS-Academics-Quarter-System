      "review": "So, I did some research and bought this switch because it is advertised as the 'NEW' model with serial number beginning with 'XKW'. It is said to have better battery life, possibly a boosted processor, and generally just be an updated switch model. That being said, the old discontinued model still retails for the same amount. I checked my model on my 'NEW AND IMPROVED' switch, and it is the sane as my 2018 switch XAW. Needless to say, I am rather disappointed in Amazon. I installed all my games, transferred data, and now I am stuck with wiping and returning it or just settling for a mediocre version of the switch. Thanks for the annoyance Amazon! Also, the left Joy-con bumper was broken right out of the box! It was also covered in grease. $300 for outdated switch, and a broken controller. I don't normally leave nasty reviews, but I'm pretty bummed. Also nintendo will switch out the outdated one, but I have to ship it to them!",

NO games NO SD memory chip for more memory capacity or even NO 6 or 12 month online account. $600.00 WOW...

So supply and demand is the reason for raising the prices on these items(taking advantage in other words) Switch for $600.00 and if buying controllers there not $60 or $70 there any color$104.99... with the exception of maybe the grey joy-cons.

      "review": "My grandson saved his money for almost a year to buy a Nintendo console by the time he turned 13 - and then of course --- they are nowhere to be found except for 3rd part sellers that have raised the price to outrageous levels.I was told by the sales person at Best Buy that even when they get them in they are sold out within 10 - 15 minutes due to BOTS that buy them all - which leaves the rest of us poor people with no chance to actually get one.I certainly understand supply and demand - and that businesses have to make money to survive - but the pricing is more than a little outrageous.On another note - although the seller indicated the device was \"new\" the box does not look new.The box has multiple places on the corners where the cardboard is dented and scratched.I am letting my grandson actually open it - but I'm hoping the device is in fact new and not damaged in anyway.",

      "title": "The switch is a unique console that has a lot of good ideas, but is poorly executed.",
      "review": "I have an loaded opinion on this console that I want to express. The Switch is flawed. As an avid gamer who usually ends up buying all the consoles (except the xbox one) and loves the hardware behind these machines, the switch was super cool when I first heard about it and saw it. I got one not to long after release once they came back to my area. Though it took awhile to save up for any games as during that point in its life, everything was expensive on it and 3rd party devs hadn't moved to it yet. Also there were no media apps on it besides hulu which somehow is still a thing, surprising. But that isn't what I want to talk about, its more how the switch feels really damn cheap.I don't mean cheap as with the plastic shell either (but that is an issue, dislike the texture a lot, and it was also damaged by strong adhesives from dbrand before), but you get a wimpy TN panel for its main built in display, in an era where amoled and ips are very obtainable for device of this size (the original psvita was oled, so it could have been possible). As the resolution is at a solid 720p, which can help balance good enough quality on the go with actual game performance, I feel like they should have opted for a nicer quality screen to have better range of colors, would have created more vivid scenes using sharper and brighter colors. Instead they chose washed out TN panels which leave a lot to be desired when comparing it to any handheld screen semi modern hand held screen with exception of DS's which also chose awful screens. (and some might argue TN for faster response time, and to that, I highly disagree with improvements to other display types, and also for the type of audience the switch aims at)Next I want to talk about the Joycons, as they are lovely little controllers that snap onto the side of the console with a satisfying click. I actually wouldn't have minded them despite being kinda awful when using them on a big screen if they worked correctly, but three years in and these things are still built to fail. There is a major design flaw in them that eventually has the analogue stick wear our and start \"drifting\", making the controller effectively useless. If these were cheap, maybe I wouldn't care as much, but they are 80$ to replace. Sure you can contact nintendo customer support and they sometimes take care of you, but this is a hassle and shouldn't even be a problem. They could have just owned up to the mistake, and redesigned the controllers at this point. ( pro controller is actually a solid design, but its more expensive then both ps4 and xbox one controllers so I dislike recommending it. I believe its the amiibo sensor that does this and that's just bad).Lastly, I kinda wanna just complain about nintendo being nintendo. But before that I want to praise them for how far they did come up to this point. There is finally 3rd party content being pushed on the Switch and thats awesome. It seems like they did listen a bit and made it much easier to get games on the Switch. Ok now onto the bad. The Switch has no utility, and I get that its a gaming console, but still its surprsing that the most mobile and potentially flexible console lacks basic OS features that things like the ps4, psvita, and even 3DS were capable of doing such as, have a variety of streaming services, a basic web browser, and customizing the layout of your home screen/having fun backgrounds. There is no personality to the switch despite it being one of the most unique consoles I have ever seen, which is quite baffling to me. Despite the console featuring bluetooth for its joycons and pro controller, you cant connect bluetooth headphones to it without a 3rd party adapter, which is a little baffling for an on the go console. The UI looks pretty ugly when put onto a big screen, just a personal gripe of mine, I really don't like it. Lastly, the game cartridges are a letdown. The reason games usually feel more expensive on the switch is because they more often then not are. This is due to the game cartridges costing more to make than blu-ray media for the other consoles. Nintendo also didn't want a disparity of cost between physical media and digital media, so if you launch a game both ways, you need to have the price be the same, which creates higher costing digital games on the switch store vs any other platform. The cost of the cartridge also varies depending on size of the game, so larger games will suffer more to this than smaller ones.That's my loaded opinion which turned more into a typed rant on the switch. Its still a pretty ok console that provides a ton of unique experiences that you can't get on any other platform. As a sole console I don't think I would recommend this unless you fully know what you are getting into, but as a side device to play exclusives its not bad. Hopefully they will release new hardware and software updates to fix many of the gripes I rambled on about.",

I've played every Nintendo console and while I was a major fan of the early ones, after the Cube, I got sucked into the Xbox 360 and then the PS4, but, this console is the first I've played in years that brings me back to that childhood magic. I got this console on a whim after watching Detective Pikachu and realizing how much I missed Pok\u00e9mon games, so I had to get Let's Go Pikachu and pre-order Pok\u00e9mon Shield, as well as getting back into Mario, and checking out Fire Emblem Warriors which is totally amazing. All in all, not only are the exclusive games amazing, but, the console and even the joycon controller rig are something special. I can't put my finger on it, and I really can't put it into words, but this is a great system and for kids or those trying to rediscover the child inside of them, this is a must have.

      "review": "If you look at Nintendo's list of exclusive games and think, \"Yeah, I'm all about that\", dive in. This is a fun console that offers play on your TV screen or handheld (switch... duh). With multiple controller configuration options including extra peripherals that will make your controller become a steering wheel, a golf club, a fishing pole, and a fitness ring just to name a few, there is a lot of fun and creativity built into Nintendo's latest console.Add to all of this, with a Nintendo Online subscription you get access to tons of free and low cost games. They have included a virtual NES and SNES console with a good selection of classic games. There are also other free games like Tetris 99 and the new Super Mario 35 which are loads of fun. There are also lots of other games that can be had for as little as $2.99If however you're looking for a console to play the latest cross platform hits, you're probably better off with a PC or one of the next gen gaming consoles. Playing a big cross platform game, you will notice a difference in graphics quality. The Switch only displays in HD, while every other console (and pc) is up to 4K now. Plus the Nintendo controllers, while fun and creative, will not hold up to long term play for something like a FPS. They are fun controllers, and work perfectly for the Nintendo games, but they feel like they would ultimately break after a few serious button mashing sessions. If you've seen all the drama about controller drift, you now know why.Bottom line is if you're all about Nintendo exclusives like Mario, Zelda, Animal Crossing, Metroid? (please?), get this console. It will provide a great deal of entertainment. If you're trying to play the big gaming hits available across all consoles and PC, there are better options.",

Lol You can tell they fixed a lot issues with the joycons and other things. My OG switch had so many flaws. My TV screen would go black then turn back on for some reason while playing. The vents on my switch ended up melting off. The back had so many scratches from the dock.Anywho, the battery life is amazing!! If you're like me and you play your switch an hour a day. It will last for a couple days. If you're the type that play your switch for hrs. You can get up to 9hrs of play depending on the game you're playing.Im glad I got the upgraded version. 5/5",

      "review": "After owning the original Wii for years and enjoying it with 0 problems I decided on getting the Switch, even though I mainly play my games on PC now a days, I thought it would be a great console for my wife and I to come together every now and then to play. I was lucky to score one when Nintendo finally got it back in stock after months of no stock because of the pandemic. The first day I got it the right (red) joy con kept disconnecting every 5-10 minutes. I was literally 5 feet away from the console with line of sight. After going through the troubleshooting steps of disconnecting joy cons and updating the console OS and controller firmware, it still had the same problem. The left (blue) joy con worked flawlessly. I searched online and found hundreds if not thousands of posts about people experiencing disconnecting joy cons and various work-arounds. Some even claimed that by having your foot propped up in front of the line of sight would cause all sorts of controller issues including lag and disconnects. So I did my long hours of testing, purchasing new official joy cons, and 3rd parties and am discouraged by my findings.Ultimately I found that the built-in bluetooth radio in the switch is just not powerful enough. Considering the amount of posts regarding controller pairing and disconnects issues, I would say the problem has been known for a long time. And instead of Nintendo recalling or replacing their poorly designed consoles they blame the environment or user error. They state things like \"make sure your console is away from wireless devices of any kind\". Seriously? Everyone has 20 wireless devices in their house from cell phones, routers, modems, smart TV's, wireless speakers, smart hubs, Alexa devices, the list goes on. Nintendo even states to keep the Switch away from fish tanks. Really? Soon they'll be saying to keep the switch away from air and light.I contacted Nintendo within the first week I got the Switch after getting fed up with dying because of constant controller lag and disconnects. Tier 1 support is a joke. They just want you to send it in which customer pays for shipping, and I may get my console back in 30 days. So after back and forth discussion with Tier 1 support I finally found that there is an escalation line which they forwarded me to which seems to be a line of seniors or assistant managers. Again they wanted me to send in the console. I called BS and explained that the console was only a week old. We finally agreed that I would temporarily pay for a replacement right joy con, and only after they received my defective right joy con that I would get reimbursed. New right joy con came, had the same problems albeit it was less noticeable, less disconnects. I sent my old one to them and it took them 30 days to refund my money which was $50 because they had to inspect the controller for any damage or mods. Seriously? I eventually got my money back but what a pain.Fast forward about a month and lag and disconnects are still happening. I purchased a brand new official joy con from Amazon and even though it hasn't outright disconnected it has shown lag issues again, sitting 5 feet away from the console and with direct line of sight. I even started unplugging wireless devices like my wireless speaker, just to see if anything would increase the controllers range and reliability and nothing helped.At the end of the day the Nintendo Switch is riddled with controller issues and I am not even getting into the whole \"drifting\" problem that people are suing Nintendo over. Now a days it seems that companies just release untested unreliable electronics, even the all and might Nintendo company, and don't take responsibility for it. A player needs reliable controllers to play a consoles content AKA joy con controllers for the Nintendo Switch, like a player needs a reliable mouse and keyboard for playing PC games. And for the price tag of an official Nintendo Switch joy con set at around $70 I expect them to be flawless, and their from from it. And this console isn't even new. It's been out for several years and Nintendo has had plenty of time to fix their issues, and they have chosen to blame us, the consumers instead of taking ownership of the problem.I plan to exchange the Switch for another using the Amazon exchange policy. Luckily, my purchase qualified for the holiday return policy so I have until February 1st to return it. If the new one acts up the same way I will be returning it and will be calling my credit card company to reimburse the 4 games I purchased from the Switch store since the Nintendo store has a no refund policy, which is a complete joke and such a policy should be discouraged.",

Don't pay these ridiculous inflated prices.It came new in the box, never used, and came with everything needed. Power adapter, dock, HDMI cable, joy-con grips, and the wrist straps. Switch had half a charge upon arrival, and set up just fine.Joy-cons work great.Reads and plays a cartridge game. I'm excited to play this more! It has very nice feeling controls, incredible graphics (compared to the Wii that I was used to), and the console is very small and compact.Don't hesitate to pick this up.

      "review": "The game system we received is the newer one with better battery life. However, we've been disappointed with the joys cons. Both right joy cons in the included one and another set we bought would disconnect. If you read online there are all kinds of issues with the joy cons ever since they made the system. There are fewer problems since they updated them, however, the joy cons we received with this system are dated 2017, before they updated them. So, new game system, old joy cons. Seriously disappointed in this. Nintendo is in the process of setting up a warranty repair, but I shouldn't have to do this for a brand new system. The individual set we bought is going back and we purchased new ones in a local store that should theoretically be newer. To initiate the repair Nintendo asked about a hundred questions and 2 hours later the repair is accepted. Not a good setup, in my opinion.",

      "review": "I absolutely loved the concept of the Nintendo Switch and decided to get one due to its popular demand. It\u2019s pretty awesome and best to get it at the normal price of $299.99 because it really isn\u2019t worth $300.00+ and it really refreshes the gaming atmosphere. However, handheld mode is so enormous that it\u2019s a little uncomfortable. I was on the fence about buying this or the Nintendo Switch Lite, because I rarely have anyone else around to play some really cool multiplayer games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Super Smash Bros. Plus, the Switch Lite doesn\u2019t come with controller/joy con problems and is smaller, more comfortable, and accessible. One other thing that stands out on the Lite is it has a smaller screen but games look a bit sharper on it. That said, some of the free games are pretty addictive! I think it was totally worth the $300.00, but it does cost $20 to buy Nintendo Online to play any Nintendo game\u2019s online player. I also wouldn\u2019t recommend buying a Pro controller because the joy con controller is pretty comfortable, so far. If you\u2019re someone who loves hanging around friends and family, get the regular Switch. If you\u2019re a solo and lone wolf type of badass, get the Switch Lite!",

      "review": "Similar to other Nintendo systems, innovation is always attached to their new ideas. The joy cons are similar to the wii remotes, albeit not as precise for some games where they were used for shooting type games, the joy cons are incredible for multiplayer. I honestly prefer using one joycon whenever I can when playing games, it's really nifty being able to play two player automatically with a friend or family member without having to pay for an expensive controller, or a cheaper built one.Nintendo Apps are so-so at the moment, it would be great to have streaming apps such as Netflix for streaming, but other apps such as Youtube have worked well streaming but I do not like the interface for searching for videos.When playing online, after paying for a year subscription, was not as bad as the days of the Nintendo Wii, but it could be better. Wifi play has always been a struggle for companies and consumers that I don't expect to go away with any patch made by Nintendo. Buying the year subscription also includes many nes/snes games you can play with the joy cons in single/multiplayer. My roommate got rehooked playing super mario world and it was a blast seeing someone who says they \"hate games with bad graphics\".Overall, if you're looking for a system for on the go or for a house hold device, the Nintendo Switch is a excellent system with a good range of games to play on. My young nephew and kid siblings are a fan of it; and same for me and several of my friends who are in our early 20s.",

Placing the console back on the dock allows you to play on the TV but what is the point if the handheld device does not work. Contacted Nintendo support and after some time-wasting, I'll need to send it in for a warranty repair. Should be without the device for over a month by current estimates.Another issue: Setting up the 37 accounts, email logins, user names, and other associated nicknames and logins is a ridiculous process.Overall, this would be a one-star review if it wasn't so much fun to play as a family or with others online.Other reviews are accurate.

It sucks that Nintendo didn't give us enough storage space, so make sure you buy a microSD card to store your games and their content. I read that it's better to buy the physical game discs. They take up less space, but if you want to download all of your games go for it. If you play a medium amount of games I would recommend the 256GB - 512GB microSD cards. There is a 1TB microSD card on amazon for around $300.00. Get this one if you're a hardcore Nintendo player. There are many accessories on amazon to also decorate your Switch. You can decorate the controllers with skins or buy the different color joy-cons. The exclusive Pickachu one has nice Pichachu designs on the stand, and I think there's also an Eevee version both from Japan that cost $500 or more. You can also buy the Switch Lite which seems much more available now with the pandemic raging. Explore and find the version of Switch that works for you.",

It has drift issues so it won't let my children go to the left and keeps moving to the right without them doing anything. I figured okay, it must be defective so I will call Amazon and hopefully they can fix this for me or just send me a new controller. Apparently NOT. Amazon says the item is out of the return window and there is nothing they can do.

Zelda breath of the wild\u2014which I borrowed from my brother later\u2014 is more intensive than anything I have played in YEARS.Games are expensive in physical format, although that is my preference.There are some cheaper games on the online store.So far my favorite local game shop does not have any used copies of Switch games although they have everything else.Maybe some day.I might buy a screen protector for it in the future but have not as of yet.If your Switch is to see heavy use by an entire family or if as an owner you plan to travel with it I\u2019d recommend one but that is not the case for me. I did have a problem within a month of ordering the machine where the fan started whirring LOUDLY.At first only when it was plugged in to charge then all the time when it was at rest, then at last even while playing a game.I called Nintendo customer service and had it repaired (although I had to send it back three times with the same issue to a radioshack in Syracuse NY.Last time I sent it in they just replaced the system.)If I have a problem in the future I will request replacement rather than repair, especially if it\u2019s going back to New York.Just not happening.At least customer service was good, but I was becoming a bit disgruntled toward the end there with their techs!For my troubles customer service gave me a new set of controllers automatically and then later, three months free on the eshop.Oh, and the second and third shipments were two day free.",

      "review": "Hey, it's a Nintendo for 2021. It's fast, simple, and the games are clean. No long loading times and the controls are fairly intuitive. Battery life on the joy-cons is great, though the handheld version is a little lackluster... that's fixed by treating it like a standard console though... so yay.Only real sticking point is the price. For 300 bucks, it feels a bit steep. Many of the games feel like time-eaters for casual players, and there's no browsing or media to speak of. Again though, this is Nintendo and as a game console, it plays games. They play smoothly and have a very finished feel to them. Sign of the times and all that.Overall, a very nice machine if you just want to sit down and play without all the bells and whistles.",

They were very quick to realize their mistake and corrected it right away. I actually got the email the same day the accessories arrived so it was absolutely fine in my book.

It was an Extra $145.00 than the original Retail Price of $300.00, but I believe that was because of the Switch Shortage that happened everywhere due to COVID-19. The actual Product I received was top notch though. It was packaged very well. I didn't have a problem opening it which I have had with some other Products which actually lead to me accidentally damaging those items. But no such problem here. The actual Switch itself was also in perfect condition. No scratches anywhere on any of it. And nothing was missing. It runs perfectly fine too. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever. I am very happy with it. The only downside, like I said, was the Price, but is understandable given the Pandemic and Shortage. So I'm giving this Five Stars. Great job!!",

You can ALSO reverse time when playing (it is a cheap feature but VERY cool still) Died in mario, just hold in two buttons, reverse the game like a dvr on tv show and bam, try that part again right where you just were!! i do not know if it is true but i read they have two more slots for future classic systems in their coding in the system. We have Nintendo 8bit, Super Nintendo but we could see Nintendo 64 or game cube in the future as well.All 5 games i picked up for it run great as well, no complaints except it was 150 dollars more than list price.

When Pokemon moved to the Switch, \"some point\" became \"right now\".Nintendo likes to make their consoles unique. The DS Lite had two screens, a touch screen, and a microphone that were all used to make the experience unique. The 3DS, The Wii, and Wii U also had their own interesting elements. At times, it just felt gimmicky. The Switch on the other hand, doesn't feel that way at all.It's the gaming equivalent of a laptop with a docking station. You can have the TV experience like any other console, which is also great for party games. Then you can take it with you. This is basically THE go to gaming device for plane rides. The joycons are also genius. It is just incredibly versatile.I'm pleased that it has USB C. The Dock is easy to connect to as it literally just drops in place. I do think it could use more apps. it pretty much only has Hulu and YouTube at the time of this review, if I'm remembering correctly. I am a bit of a geek so I have plenty of other devices to watch on, but if it wants to compete with some of the other devices, it would be nice to have the option of watching Netflix, for example.I remember when the Wii first came out, and you'd go play the sports games with whoever had one. The novelty wore off before long. The Switch however, is here to stay. Brilliant device",

I only have one game on it so far, but to say I'm pleased and impressed so far is a bit of an understatement. It's nice to be able to play on my TV in the living room, and when someone else wants to play their own game or watch Netflix, I can just take the switch out of the dock and play in handheld mode, but stay in the same room and socialize. I like being able to bring the game into my room and not be forced to play it in the living room if I don't want to deal with all the noise.It's pleasant to hold, with just a bit of weight to it to feel sturdy. The Joycons are nice to the touch, although the sticks are a little too 'smooth' for my liking so I put some grips on. I haven't experienced any drift, yet, but it's only been a few days. They're very satisfying to hold, and even more satisfying to click into place on either the tablet or the included joy-con grip. I haven't tried the straps yet.The screen is lovely, and the speakers are front-facing so it seems louder than other handhelds. It IS a little frustrating to adjust the volume while I have it on the kickstand. The kickstand is a pain to pull out, and isn't sturdy in the slightest.Overall I'm very, very happy with it.

      "review": "The Nintendo Switch is a nearly perfect gaming device for family use. With our one-TV household our Xbox Series S spends more time streaming Netflix than gaming while the Nintendo Switch can entertain both on the big screen and away from it.Out of the box it took a bit of time to get gaming as you need a Nintendo account. Pokemon Quest was the simplest and quickest to get going with. We haven't yet tried any \"physical\" games meaning we've only tried games you download (which the Xbox Series S/X excels at.)The multi-modality of the Nintendo Switch is great but be prepared to be disciplined with the various bits or you'll lose them. You'll also want to buy a screen protector and a carrying case. The build quality is pretty good but there is some flex when using it in mobile mode. The default brightness is underwhelming while the max brightness of the screen is only good enough if you are used to top-end mobile phones. The controller buttons are not backlit and have small print so for older parents like me you'll have to memorise what is X, A, B, Y etc.Nintendo Online is somewhat confusing and not quite what you get from Xbox Game Pass. Setting up kids profiles from the parent's Nintendo account is more complicated than it should be and creates blockers if you are away from WiFi. Nintendo, just let people play offline or online and sync it later.The games on offer are family friendly without being childish. You can relive Super Nintendo games with the Nintendo Online subscription. There are more games to create and explore than games to destroy and kill. The free-to-play games include some usual suspects but the list is quite short. There is no Roblox on the Nintendo Switch, yet, and you'll have to buy Minecraft, again.",

The Nintendo game lineup also has the best exclusives out of the other competitors, from Mario to Zelda to Animal Crossing, there\u2019s a game that suits anyone\u2019s taste. Of course there are improvements to be made such as the joycons being small and sometimes uncomfortable in the even if you put it in together like a controller, it still doesn\u2019t replace the feeling of a real full sized controller. In the future, I would just like Nintendo to make the portable screen 1080p with a 120hz refresh rate for an even better gaming experience. But overall, with its creativity and innovation still standing strong 3 years later, there isn\u2019t much you can\u2019t love about the Nintendo Switch.",

A lot of ideas that Nintendo tried out on the Wii U went on to be implemented even better on the Switch - such as the handheld game pad. And the games! Mario Kart 8? First on Wii U.

      "review": "The ability to swap from dock to handheld still amazes me to this day. The library of games is crazy good, The battery life isn't bad, and the build is fairly durable. The screen is prone to scratching due to it being plastic, but a $10 screen protector fixes that easily. The controllers do go bad over time. I would recommend also purchasing a pro controller due to it having a better feel for me personally and they last far longer than any Joycon I've had. This purchase date was for my sister but I've had mine since near release and have gone through 3 pairs of Joycon, meanwhile my oldest pro controller (between 4 or 5 years) of the 3 I currently have has only shown slight signs of degradation. There is a \"Nintendo tax\" on some games which basically means they cost more than they would on other consoles (e.g. Borderlands collection I got on pc for like $20 where as the switch is charging $50 for games released between 2009-2014 so that you can play them on graphically worse hardware, but the portable part may be worth it for some people with certain games). The online services are really bad a lot of the time especially when playing with people who are far away or have otherwise unstable connections. Playing with random people online can be a very painstaking process a lot of the time. With all this being said, I love this console. It is the only console I use (I also have a pc and a ps4). I only look at it so critically due to how much I love it. If I didn't spend hours and hours using this thing I wouldn't be telling you all it's flaws in a 4-star review. It can be frustrating sometimes, but the exclusives are amazing (there are also a lot of great 3rd party games but I mainly mean that BOTW is a masterpiece and Mario Odyssey is phenomenal) and the \"home console and handheld\" idea is honestly incredible. I basically wrote an essay about this thing to tell you how much I love it.",

It didn't take me more than 10-minutes after opening the box and setting up the Switch to see why it's such a hot item. It is worth every penny!",

You buy something and it doesn\u2019t last 8 months (less than thst bc I made him play on it a couple of months before sending it in). We have to pay to get something repaired that didn\u2019t make it a year. Totally unfair. What\u2019s to break next?

      "review": "I bought this for my son for Christmas... two weeks later it simply stopped taking charge with no apparent damage to the charging port. Sent it to Nintendo for repair, they sent it back unrepaired and said it was not covered by the warranty. I recently sent it again and was charged by Nintendo $115 for repair. My issue here is that Amazon is selling defective products, Nintendo does not want to fix their products nor did they reach out to me to ask if I want to pay for the repair. It costs more than $300, who in their right mind would throw it away. Now to repair I paid more than $100 so I'm close to $500 for a damn Switch! I could of just bought a PS5 with that money.",

You do need to make a Nintendo account, though, if you don't already have one in order to play on it, but overall set up was easy and didn't take too long.

At the end of the day, if you want a Switch and there is nowhere real close by that has them in stock, I'd reccomend it.

Nintendo has completely out classed their competition with this wonderful piece of machinery that is guaranteed to have you busy for hours. And this is coming from a die-hard Sony fan :). The sleek but comfortable design of the joycons makes intense gameplay surprisingly seamless. Their massive game selection ranges from AAA titles, to RPGs, First Person Shooters, and MUCH MORE. There is so much more that could be said, however, it\u2019s too much to type! Lol. If you\u2019re looking for an excellent game console that you can play either casually or continuously, look no further. Additionally, if you\u2019re like me (frugal) and you\u2019re on the fence about shelling out the money, don\u2019t be; it\u2019s worth every penny. Also, this seller moved my shipping up to one day shipping FOR FREE!!! Literally the BEST SELLER I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. Would definitely order from this seller again. Do yourself a favor and buy the switch!",

You can get Hulu but you can buy a smart tv for the price and have Hulu and 4 k. The streaming from Hulu has been seamless. The joy con controllers feel weird and the thumb sticks are in inappropriate places for easy and well controlled play. I would never buy. Someone plz trade me their Xbox.",

Comes with everything you need except a carry case (which I would recommend instead of putting in your backpack lose) as well as picking up a good sized Micro SD card. I got like a 200gb one for $30-40 so I will never lose one of the tiny came cartridges.It's light weight and feels a little fragile, but not cheap feeling. Just wouldn't recommend dropping it like EVER. Anyway, great for all ages like 8-99yo.

Not sure why they couldn\u2019t just discount it at purchase. So inevitably it went wrong and I needed to complain - hence dropping a few stars. Now I have a promotional credit that can be applied to eligible items but doesn\u2019t appear on my account. So basically, don\u2019t get too excited about the promo offer as it is super painful to get the money.",

      "review": "Man, where do I start.Ok, the system itself is a great concept for someone that lives in a perfect world to where nothing would affect its Architectual structure. Don't get me wrong it has a lot of great family games and the quality of the graphics are as well great, but Nintendo still has a lot of work to do.Joysticks- Well, I will start off by saying that this system has been handled by myself, my 7-year-old now 11-year-old son, 13 now 17-year-old son, and 14 now 18-year-old daughter. So, we loved to play Mario Kart and any other family games we could find for the switch. At one point (only having the system for no more than 8 months) one of my kids started complaining that their character was moving by itself. I figured joystick was stuck so I moved it around a little and that somewhat fixed the issue. As time progressed so did the problem.I contacted Nintendo which they gave me the standard trouble shooting procedures which I did but did not fix the issue. I did my own research and found out that the joysticks would drift on their own and the only way to fix this was to replace the joysticks on the controller (the black thumb sticks that are a part of the controller themselves). At the time Nintendo was going to charge me $100 to send in my console just to get it fixed (no thank you) I found another method to fix the issue myself for $10 and that is the route I went. Till this day they are still having issues with the joystick \"drifting\", but they (Nintendo) will not admit to the issue. BUT! I believe they are fixing the issue for free now even though they claim it is not an issue.Docking station- Works well, but if you are not careful you will scratch your screen. Also, if you are not careful you will break the charging port that is on the docking station in your Nintendo Switch. This is of course accidents that can be avoidable depending on the age of the child, or the supervision of handling the device. If your docking station stops working, it is cheaper to buy a C port adapter with power access than it is to buy the expensive docking station. The difference is about $40 I believe.the tablet itself- This thing is durable, but at the same time flimsy. It works to how you need it, but after having it for so long the controllers do not want to stay in place. There are products that Nintendo sells that can help with this of course and make it last longer so that they joysticks do not accidently pop out, but if you are on a spending limit. You will just have to wait till next time and hope whoever you are buying it for is not rough with the system, or constantly takes the controllers off the tablet to play certain games (which the system was intended for).I really do love this system faults and all, but it saddens me when such a great system has so many faults. On top of all that the price on this thing honestly is not worth the buy given everything you deal with. It has been holding strong at $300+ for nearly 4 years now which in my opinion is not worth it at this point. If I knew what I was buying was so fragile I would have waited, but then again, I can honestly say I could go work for the Nintendo repair crew.Just being honest and hoping that you get the full aspect of what you are buying if you haven't already bought one. As well as to think on who you are buying it for when spending that much money. Hope this helps",

I understood there were only a handful of games available (no... having thousands of crappy $10 Indie games available is not a replacement for actual games). I understood Nintendo would take seriously everything that made the Wii U a failure.I will keep this short. Here are my cons:- controllers are horrid (my pro controller stopped working after a year... won't even turn on). My joycons go to home screen when a button is pressed... the left stick drifts like mad.- Game library is noticeably lackluster. Where are the Nintendo games... no I do not mean Wii U games ported to Switch... or ten year old bestsellers now on Switch- Where are the classic Nintendo Games. Why can I not play Ocarina of Time with my kids... do I REALLY have to get a Wii?- The games almost never go on sale... ever... and when they do, it is still not a great deal. Yeah, I want to pay $40 for Skyrim... which sells for $15 everywhere else... PC has sold it for $9- The paid online sucks... what is my money going to? Ok, Splatoon 2 and Minecraft need it... what the heck else am I going to use it for? I can't play Splatoon 2 now, because you money grabbed and gave me what? What am I getting out of this? What? There is nothing good about it... at all...After writing this review, I realized how much disappointment I have with this console... I actually reduced the star rating from 3 to 2. No, it's not a 1... it's better than that. I do not want to hate this purchase, I want Nintendo to provide better service to their customers.",

So much faulty hardware it's ridiculous. Shortly after purchasing you'll realize your joycons are broken, drifting to the side which ruins the gaming experience. (I've gone through 3, yes, THREE pairs of $80 joycons.) And they will disconnect from the console as a whole which sucks as well especially if you're on an online game or a combat orientated game like BOTW and Splatoon. Leaving you a sitting duck ready to lose because you have to wait for your joycons to reconnect. Also, there is such an issue with the joycons as a whole there have been class action lawsuits against Nintendo because of them. My joycons don't even connect for handheld play anymore so my switch has become a stationary console, and then next to obliterate any chances of me enjoying my switch, that cost just as much as my quality controlled systems like my Xbox, the fan completely quit working which has reduced this console to a ticking time bomb of how long I can actually enjoy it before it auto shuts off unless I fork up the $80 to get it repaired.

Wait a few months for the prices to go back to normal OR if you NEED a Switch right now, go buy a Switch Lite.

      "review": "Some backstory: I'm a grown woman.As a kid we had an N64 and an original PlayStation.I transitioned to PC gaming in my teens and never looked back to consoles.As an adult I have never had a Wii, Xbox, or newer-generation Playstation.I, like many others, was looking for something to do in my spare time during the COVID pandemic besides watching movies and television.I bought this console in September 2019.I don't have any existing ties to a console (all the controllers are greek to me and would need to be learned) or game franchise.Pros:- The flexibility of this console impresses me even months later.I love being able to grab the unit from the dock and walk around the house with my Pokemon Sword game uninterrupted when someone else wants to use the TV.I love being able to take my unit to a friend's house and dock there.I love being able to use the joycons separately, together in a grip, or use \"pro style\" controllers.It's obviously a huge selling point and it hasn't disappointed.Looking forward to travelling with it someday.- Great mix of major, indie, and free titles.We have played some of the \"major\" games (Pokemon) and freemium stuff (Rocket League, Asphalt 9) but gravitate toward strategy/puzzle games like Overcooked 2, Moving Out, Untitled Goose Game, and Donut County.Maybe a similar mix is available on other platforms, I'm just pleasantly surprised at the variety compared to my childhood N64 and PS1 collections.We still have lots of popular games like Zelda or Super Mario to check out in the future.Cons:- The graphics aren't amazing compared to top of the line Xbox or PS consoles.- Certain games have considerable lag/latency during gameplay.- Felt like a decent number of accessories were basically required at the get-go.Have purchased a screen protector, third party controller, hard case for travelling, grips for the individual joycons, and an SD card.Of course no games come included so the price of games is added on to that.- Almost everyone I know who's had the console for at least a year complains about the joycons breaking or drifting.I expect we'll need to replace ours at some point in the next year.",

Pokemon sword and shield?Complete lag fest with so much graphics culling you run into invisible Pokemon walking around in wild areas.Let's talk games while we're on the subject.There were so few games released for the switch at launch that Nintendo scrambled to find some.Now the eshop it's overrun with shovelware in such quantity you'll never be able to browse through them all to find decent games.Extremely few AAA titles unless they're several years old and you guessed it, they still run badly.Otherwise it's a ton of badly ported mobile games for this over-glorified tablet.You bought one of their many games that don't run well on the limited hardware and it makes you literally sick to play it?Well Nintendo doesn't give refunds.According to them you should have went to YouTube and researched that they were trying to cheat you so it's your fault.Check their FAQ on refunds and you'll see they say you should have known there was a problem.Honestly if Pokemon Arceus is as big of a trashfire as not-so brilliant diamond was then I'm done with Nintendo till they stop ripping off their customers.They used to make solid consoles, then came the New 3DS with it's faulty hinges and then locking consoles if you didn't agree to their new EULA (it happened, Google it) and it's snowballed from there.Get a Steamdeck and stop rewarding bad businesses.",

Outside of the pokemon series, which was a joy to re live, there's only one reason to pick a switch over a ps5, x box or god, a pc.That reason is portability. Maybe if i flew more...Anyway, controls are clunky, game variety sucks, Nintendo couldn't get in on any of the major releases due to their hardware being of low performance and the few exclusives they do own they ruined ( zelda botw's combat is a good example)Honesty, the pirated copies on pc have better graphics and controls...that aint right man.They should just stick to re making the same games they have for 30 years and leave the platforms to the big boys, IF, they do not intend to:step up to 4k/ 60 psGet in on dev costs to get more games besides mario blah blah blah.Design better controllers/ button layout is against the grain for rest of platforms these days.

      "review": "The Switch Lite may fall short in many areas, but this is the one to get. Its an improved original switch, with better battery life. However about 2 hours of battery life is the only difference, so if you find the old switch at a discount price that may be worth getting as well. This one has all the features and you can be sure all games will work with it, unlike the Switch Lite. The Switch Lite isn't worth getting IMO.The biggest pro IMO of the switch is the detachable joy-con's. I have never seen a handheld with detachable joy-con's before this one, and its a huge improvement. If you get sticky buttons, worn out buttons or have a problem with your joy-con's you can just swap them with a new set instead of having to replace the whole handheld. Because of Joy-con drift Nintendo is now fixing Joy-Con's for free so you can buy 2 sets of joy-con's and send one out while the other set is getting fixed. I play Pokemon and a lot of it which requires mashing the A button a lot so I used to find that the A button got worn down much faster than other buttons on previous systems. It was a very complicated procedure to fix this problem on previous handhelds, they didn't come apart too easily if you could get them apart at all. If you tinker or like taking things apart its much easier to take apart a single joy-con and replace a button pad rather than it is to take apart most of a handheld to reach the part that needs to be replaced. This increases the longevity of the system and makes it more durable without having to spend a lot of money on future systems.Its important that you look for the switch with the red box when buying, this is the newer model, the older model comes in a white box. Some places are still selling the older version for the same price as the new.",

      "review": "I\u2019ve had the Nintendo switch for 2 and 1/2 years now. We don\u2019t use it every day and only put a few hours on the console per week. The console idea is fun and works pretty well changing between the tablet and tv. Our first issue was with the joy-con about a year in to ownership. The joy stick would drift you out of play, even when not being touched. It happened a little at first, then got worse. The Nintendo was still under warranty, so all I had to do was send it in. I had to pay my own shipping and handling but the repair was covered by Nintendo. Annoying that it failed after a year, but paying $20 at the time seemed like not a big deal. Our latest problem is a serious one. We\u2019ve owned it for 2.5 years and it now won\u2019t charge or turn on. I\u2019ve tried all the trouble shooting steps with no luck. It needs to be sent in to Nintendo for a repair. No longer in warrant the repair is going to cost me $99 + about $20 shipping and handling. So 2.5 years in and I\u2019ll have paid almost 1/2 of what the Nintendo originally cost on repairs and shipping. Seems ridiculous to me. I would expect this maybe after 5 years, but I\u2019ve had other consoles I\u2019ve owned for years and I\u2019ve NEVER had to repair them.

      "title": "An Amazing Little Console",
      "review": "The Nintendo Switch is a great gaming console for people new to gaming and veterans alike. Offering an extensive library of games for both kids and adults, it\u2019s a device the whole family can enjoy. It\u2019s substantially more affordable than its competitors Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One, and Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4. Produced by the well-known gaming giant Nintendo, a company with over 131 years of gaming entertainment under its belt, consumers can rest assured that they are making a quality purchase.The Switch is a hybrid gaming console released by Nintendo on March 3rd, 2017. Since its debut, it has received a significant hardware upgrade in addition to limited editions of the console. On September 20th, 2019, the Switch Lite was released nationwide. This version of the console lacks the hybrid functionality, giving up the ability to connect to a TV in favor of a lower price and a smaller, lighter form factor. The standard console is available at most retailers and online for $299 and the Lite for $199, though COVID 19 has seen these prices climb substantially higher. For this review, I will be focusing on the standard upgraded edition of the platform.The main appeal of a hybrid console is that it can be used in two configurations: handheld mode for portable play, or placed into its dock allowing the device to stream to a TV. The small controllers, called Joy-Cons, slide into slots on the sides when in handheld mode. They can also be removed and used as two separate controllers, saving parents $80 on a second controller for multiplayer situations when docked. The new revision includes a more power-efficient CPU, the brain of the console, and a brighter, more vibrant screen. Upgrading the CPU has led to a 30 percent increase in efficiency, meaning more gaming time when away from a power source. The old battery is reported to last 2.5-6.5 hours and the new one 4.5 to 9 hours, depending on the game and how high the brightness of the screen is set.In terms of software, the Switch offers an extensive library, a must for any gaming console. Without ample software to support the platform, the audience may quickly run out of games to play or things to do; this is not the case with the Switch. The library of games available for purchase can be accessed through the built-in eShop. These games can be downloaded to an SD card inserted into the system. Games can also be purchased physically in a cartridge format for those who would prefer the longevity of owning their library physically. The collection of games offered is vast and ranges from family-friendly titles such as Mario, Zelda, and Donkey Kong; to more adult titles such as Doom, Skyrim, and Wolfenstein: The New Colossus. The support for this system is incredible, primarily due to the fact that the install base is so large. The surge in sales has given incentive to developers and publishers to create more content, something which cannot be said about the previous Nintendo console, the Nintendo Wii U. Even after being on the market for more than three years, the substantial library of games shows no sign of this growth slowing down.At purchase straight out of the box, you get: The main console, two Joy-Cons, the Joy-Con grip accessory, two wrist straps for the controllers, the dock, an AC power adapter, and an HDMI cable. SD cards, games, and Nintendo Online must be purchased separately. Consumers wishing to use the online services can buy a membership for $3.99 a month, $7.99 for three months, or $19.99 for a year. A family plan is also offered at $34.99 a year and covers up to eight consoles. Members gain access to exclusive game titles, Super Mario Brothers 35 and Tetris 99. Membership also includes over seventy NES and Super NES titles. Additionally, Nintendo will allow players to back up thei game saves to the cloud, easing fears of ever losing game progress. What is lacking, however, is any real social aspect to the online community. Without voice chat, a means to message your friends, or in-game achievements, the platform falls short, in this regard, compared to its competitors. Customers have voiced complaints on this matter for years, only to be ignored.Another negative to be aware of is the issue of Joy-Con drift. Over time the thumbsticks are known to wear out, and games will register input when there is no action being performed by the player. Nintendo has vehemently fought against claims that this is an issue, even to the point of being taken to court by many parties in the form of class-action lawsuits. Drift is a reasonably widespread phenomenon and cannot be overstated; the likelihood that you will experience issues with the longevity of your Joy-Cons is high. This may or may not be a concern, as Nintendo offers to replace controllers that experience this. If you have issues with faulty controllers, you\u2019ll likely need to purchase additional ones. The controllers can be bought separately from the console for $80 for use until Nintendo gets around to repairing the ones you already own.In conclusion, I still highly recommend this system despite its shortcomings. The hours I have spent enjoying a vast collection of exciting, engaging titles on it have far outweighed any frustration I have experienced with the controllers' durability or the lackluster online experience. The ability to take your game from the living room to on the go and back again is a real treat. If you\u2019re a busy person looking for an affordable console, this is sure to meet your needs.",

      "review": "Minecraft lovers beware! We bought this system two years ago, because they had released minecraft for the switch that year and my son loves minecraft. I have always loved Nintendo products and feel as if they are more suitable for children. With that being said, this system has been nothing but a headache from the get go! The game is glitchy, won't load, or constantly shuts off mid-game. Nintendo has to know the Minecraft game is this way because its been this way for two years with no improvement. We have played on other systems with no problem. We have also had problems with our joy con controllers. The joy stick on both gets stuck in forward and its a pain to get them to connect to the system EVERYTIME! It even doesnt want to connect to it when you slide into the sides to play on the go. Needless to say I feel let down by Nintendo and feel this product is very poorly made. Controllers are also very expensive for this sysyem to not last longer than they did! Don't buy just go with a different system! Unless your child loves mario just buy a different system.",

      "review": "I\u2019m so disappointed to just be learning that Nintendo has one of the WORST ecosystems around, I wanted to love them. We got our lite first then a week later a regular switch. I purchased a few (overpriced!) games with the lite, with my account and soon learned my daughter or wife can\u2019t play them in their accounts. Then my wife and I started playing Animal Crossing, I setup my island first and later she did but she remarked how her island had the same name as mine. Turns out Nintendo intentionally limits you to the same island per switch console!WTF kind of money grab is that bulls$&*t Then I purchased 3 months of online gaming on my account on my Switch and started playing the streaming SNES games. My daughter started playing on her lite under my account so she could play Paw Patrol that I had purchased on my account on the lite. It kicked me offline immediately since you can\u2019t have two online at the same time in the same account. So if you have multiple family members, they all need accounts and need to purchase their games all separate on their own accounts. I have never, ever, before seen other gaming systems with such intentional money grab schemes in my life. I tried adding the other accounts together as a family account but Nintendo verifies this by charging the main accounts card! You can just send an email to verify but instead need to charge their card! I\u2019d advise staying away from such a ridiculous product.",

      "review": "Albeit, the games are good, and the family enjoys the use of it, as a parent I have HUGE ISSUES with the product!Although this is a cross portable/console gaming system, Nintendo fails to add basic theft deterrent measures:Example:1) There is no way to add a PIN to prevent unauthorized users from using your device. (All other game systems do! Xbox, PlayStation, Android and even the draconian Apple devices.)2) This device requires internet connection to configure it, and requires a internet connection from time to time for updates and other internal functions, yet, there is NO WAY FOR USERS TO TRACK THEIR DEVICE WHEN ITS LOST!So if your device is lost or stolen, too bad for you (us)!Besides that, there are other outrageous inconsistencies with the gaming standards!1) You may ONLY OWN 1 SWITCH. Once you link it to your Nintendo account, that is it!So if you have a family with 2-3 kids, you cannot buy a digital games once and family share, however all the other gaming platforms allow this!ie: Xbox, PlayStation, Google Play and even the draconian Apple.Also, Nintendo products (consoles and games) are almost never on sale. Although that is not a \"defect\" or \"bug\", its just a bad company practice and makes this system less appealing to parents who don't want (or need to) spend a small fortune with \"games\".I rather buy (and have done so) 3 XBoxs and everyone is playing together just fine.That, and the limited amount of cross-platform games Nintendo has to offer (only Fortnite & Minecraft) makes the Nintendo Switch a poor value for purchase and enjoyment.I recommend everyone NOT to buy Nintendo Switchs until their management fixes and addresses all of these issues.",

The games are fun and interactive while also being able to be played with friends and family, this console and its games have brought much joy to nights in with friends and family. My friends and I find ourselves playing the Nintendo Switch for hours when we hang out and my family has game nights once a week where we like to enjoy Mario Party, Mario Kart, and other multiplayer games made for this console. The Nintendo Switch allows me to play old school games that I once enjoyed as a child, which bring nostalgic feelings. This console can last and be added onto by buying joy-cons and attachments for each game, the biggest pro for this console is the fact that it can be played alone or with others. Enjoying the new and old games on this console with friends and family is always a good time, when the Nintendo Switch is brought up everyone involved is ready to indulge in all the great selections they have for the console. One downfall for this system is that not all games from the past are yet available for the public to play, Nintendo slowly releases games for this console old and new. The only perk I could think of to fix this minor issue is having all old school games released when the Nintendo Switch was first released, this would allow more games to play that were once played by adults when they were children. I recommend this console to anyone who enjoys Nintendo games, it can bring a night together easily with friends and family. This console is very kid-friendly and also has a huge adult fan base, all games can be enjoyed by any age group and allow individuals to play the games they enjoy together.",

      "review": "I\u2019ve had my Nintendo Switch for about a year and half and I can definitely say I have not regretted that purchase since. Although I have the original version that has the shorter battery life, this shouldn\u2019t take away from the review. I still have managed to seek hundreds of hours into all my games. As of right now I have 5 games which includes Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Pokemon Sword, and Fire Emblem Three Houses. These are all great games to choose but I recommend Super Mario Odyssey as your first game of choice as it is super enjoyable for just about everyone. The Switch feels great in both handheld and TV mode. To summarize, the Nintendo Switch is an amazing product for not only hardcore Nintendo Fans but also for average person or family.But to get to why you should consider getting a Nintendo Switch, the first and most marketed reason is that you can both play it on your TV and on the go. When the Nintendo Switch goes to handheld mode, it experiences very little noticeable graphic drops. Being able to play your favorite games whenever you want is an amazing experience, especially with such high graphics compared to other handheld consoles. The second reason is that a lot of games with multiplayer, both first and third party, allow the Switches new joy-con controllers to be split into two controllers so two people can play at the same time without buying another controller. Some of the big games that are compatible with this are Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart, which are the Switches top 10 highest selling games. As for the third and final reason is that all first party games and most third-party games offer a great game play and an overall great experience to a game. The Switch even comes with a grip to hold both of them together and wrist strips for when they are separate. A small point to add is that the rest of Switch items, the two chords and dock are really easy to set-up and take anywhere. It\u2019s made easier to carry them with the overabundance of Switch accessories everywhere.However, the Switch does have some minor downsides depending why you would buy a Switch. If you\u2019re wanting something with the best graphic the Switch isn\u2019t for you and you would be better off buying a PlayStation 4 or Xbox one. You do have to pay to be able to pay online, which I do have under a family pass. This is known as Nintendo online isn\u2019t liked by many people as they don\u2019t want to pay to play on online or dislike that they hide quality of life benefits through a pay wall. What Nintendo online also includes is cloud safe data for mostly only first party games, a complaint I have would be that this isn\u2019t supported for all games including some first party ones. I feel that it is priced very well compared to other paid online usage in other consoles. It is priced at $19.99 a year, $4.99 a month, and if you can with a couple of friends pay a few amounts for the $34.99 family pass, which is still cheaper than a full year of PlayStation\u2019s online service. Another benefit includes being able to play classic games from both the original NES and Super Nintendo. This extra service that comes with Nintendo online brings many games to play from those consoles and adds new ones every now and then. I feel like this is better than having to repurchase classic Nintendo games with every new console and just have them there. One last point to add is if you don\u2019t really see yourself playing on the TV that much, the Nintendo Switch Lite is a great alternative as it is only to be used for portability.",

However, for a child to use it, you MUST make your own Nintendo account as well as a child account, download the app to set some parental controls, then use their website to set another round of parental controls. Really poorly designed and not intuitive. For example, when making an account, it allows you to use Google, Facebook etc instead of setting a unique Nintendo password. Convenient! However, you can\u2019t buy anything without a parental password, so once you get father along and try to download something, they forgot about the Google sign in and you need to go back to the beginning and set up new Nintendo password for the parent.

      "review": "Switch\u2019s big sell is its versatility. As I\u2019ve already stated, it\u2019s both a handheld and a home console. Its innards are powerful enough to deliver better-than-Wii U visuals, no matter where you happen to be. If you want to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the bus, you can. If you\u2019d rather sit in front of your TV and sink your teeth into some competitive online Splatoon 2, you can do that too. Heck, if you fancy a two-player game of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe while sat in the park, I would be 100% behind that decision.Pro: It\u2019s extremely flexible. The main selling point of Switch is its ability to transform from a home console to a portable gaming system in a snap. And on that front, it works as well as advertised. Transitioning from one style of gaming to another takes seconds and lets you continue playing right where you left off. A likely use-case is people who want to keep playing when their spouse/parent/roommate wants to watch something on the TVCon: Unfortunately, the Switch\u2019s internal memory is just as small as the hardware\u2019s footprint, which, if you\u2019re planning on buying most of your games digitally, is going to be a sizable headache. The system has just 32GB of internal storage, some of which is reserved for the operating system",

Ihave looked up ways to try to fix this i have cleaned my contoller but nothing is working and im so frustrated. I have about 10 games on my switch which now im unable to play.I will show pictures or videos if necessaryIf any nintendo employee sees this i will gratefully appreciate if i canrequest for a new joycons or a new switch.",

On the other hand, I got it for the actual retail price of $299.99 so I have no real reason to complain about it's battery life, especially when I usually have it docked and am playing on my T.V.It also has a ton of great games, both first and third party, big developer and indie developer. one thing though, you're going to want a micro SD card with a lot of space if buying a lot of digital games like i did because the Switch has only 32 GB internal memory.There is also the matter of the Switch Online Service which is $20 a year for the individual plan, but seeing as the competition is charging twice that, not a big deal breaker to me.Now a list of games to try:Get 10 Quest-a great little indie puzzle game available digitally for $4Tetris 99-A classic puzzle game turned into a battle with 98 other players. was free to start, but $10 for DLC.Hollow Knight-Excellent but hard metroidvaina game that is a better deal digitally than physical copy. $20/$34Super Mario Odyssey-it's a Mario game. -shrugs-Dragon Quest XI-Great JRGP.",

The amount of time spent with the Switch dwarfs the others, with the gaming PC coming in a distant second. I see no need to purchase Xbox / PS consoles moving forward as they are fully redundant / less robust in comparison to the gaming PC. The Switch, with its portability, occupies a different niche. But more importantly, the standout games it does have are what makes the difference. I put more hours into Fire Emblem: Three Houses in 1 month than I have played my PS in its lifetime. Breath of the Wild was a spectacular introduction to the system.This is the console to own if you are going to have a console.",

The Nintendo Switch it's self is wireless lol meaning it supports WI-FI. The additional remotes that you can buy aka controllers are so cheaply made and the dock is also made from cheap plastic parts. You drop this thing once and trust me it's gonna break into a million pieces. The games are so over priced and they are literally installed on some sort of SD card...., Really!? The memory is stored on an additional microSD and microSDXC cards, and has 32GB of internal NAND memory. So be prepared to buy more memory. The HDMI cable the console comes with is literally a cheap $3 dollar cable you can buy at Walmart lol. Where is Mike Tyson's Punch out in 3D new and improved? Why is this console NOT backwards compatible? Why have an internal USB 3.0 port but only supports 2.0? Are you freaking kidding me!? No software updates? No additional upgrades? Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 should of been on the same game! Super Mario 64 should of been in widescreen HD! We should be able to play all our old Mario, Zelda and punch-out games on this console in 3D renewed!~ Yes the only games worth playing are the Mario Franchised ones and of course Zelda's breath of the wild.

      "review": "The console was fun and my son loved it when he got it for Christmas. We really enjoyed it for the month that it worked.We opened the system on Christmas day and it stopped working on January 24. There was no damage done to it, no drops, no spills, nothing. My son tried to start Pokemon Shield and the system crashed and displayed an error message. Then the screen went black and it would never turn back on.When calling Nintendo customer service I was told repeatedly that they think it was mishandled or dropped and that caused the damage. Finally they agreed to honor the 1 year warranty and repair it after assuring them multiple times that the console was not abused. Remember that the system did not even male it 1 month without breaking. After voicing concerns I was assured that we would not lose our saved data. Today I was notified that the system has been repaired and we lost all of our saved data. The internal power supply crapped out and they don't know why.I highly recommend not buying this system. It has caused a lot of unhappiness in our house and we still have never been given an explanation as to what caused the problem. Spend your hard earned money on a higher quality system. You and your family deserve better than this cheaply made, overpriced, and poorly supported console.",

Just keep buying other controllers. Visually mediocre. Avoid at all costs. Nintendo needs an entire regroup as a whole after this one. People will say it's fun but they are lying to themselves. If you grab a couple oversized Wii wheels Mario kart is solid but it's pretty much the same as Mario kart on Wii. The last good product they put out. My advice put the thing up for sale along with your Wii u on offer up or marketplace and dust off your Wii. Cause this is a train wreck from top to bottom. Slow loading visually poor it just goes on and on and on. I will never turn my back on Nintendo due to years of joy and great nostalgia but they are starting to push it",

The two joycons can be used for two person play, basically one controller set can be used as two controllers for some games.

The system is rugged and well built and we have no problems with it when it comes to its hardware.

If you have large hands I'd also suggest getting a remote control that fits your hands. I like that the switch has so many options available of controllers. all of the players in my house have been able to find forms that are comfortable for them. As a huge Mario fan there's no other place for me to get these titles. the biggest hit on the system is that many of the streaming services do not have applications or programs available at this time which is just strange to me.",

Overall this is who it\u2019s for: if your moving constantly, don\u2019t have a lot of time to play, don\u2019t want to hassle with wires, don\u2019t mind low Quailty gameplay with the upside of play anywhere in the world at any time, and want a solid experience with exclusive games this is for you.

      "title": "Amazing Product... With Some Drawbacks",
      "review": "The Nintendo Switch is, by all means an amazing... and perhaps my favorite \"console\" from Nintendo thus far: it has amazing games and the portability is a huge bonus! But it's not void of some major drawbacks, and I wouldn't recommend paying more than $300 for it... as by that point it's simply not worth it.It comes with the Switch console, an HDMI cable, a USB-C + A/C charger, two wrist straps which the controllers mount to, a mount that turns the two side-controllers into a standalone controller, and finally a system mounting station: where you can plug in things like the HDMI cord, the charging cable, etc. and simply mount your Switch at any time for \"wireless\" charging (similar to a wireless charging mount on a phone).Now, here's the problems and why I wouldn't pay more than $299 for it:1) The battery is absolutely terrible. On a full 100% charge, unless you set the brightness to less than 75% it will last maybe a whopping 3-4 hours. And setting the brightness below 75% just looks... awful and dim. By modern standards this just isn't great... as my cell phone, which packs more horsepower than the Switch, easily lasts 15 hours on a full charge. The Switch does not. It also takes quite a long time to charge, so there's no fast-charging.2) The display resolution isn't great by modern standards. While it's not bad, you would think a current-gen console would have at least UHD or WQHD. It doesn't, and the most you can get out of it, even when hooked to an external display is 1080p.3) The speakers are simply not good. Turned all the way up to max volume, you will still barely be able to hear this if you're sitting next to a fan or a window A/C unit. In other words, it's hard to hear unless you're sitting in a silent room. It also sounds like you're sitting in a can. It does have a 3.5mm aux for headphones, so that's a bonus.4) The USB-C charging port is placed on the bottom of the Switch, rendering any stand or mount useless while it's plugged in. This is a poor design choice, since if you want to play with the Switch plugged in (which you'll often need to do, thanks to the poor battery), you will have to either hold it or lay it flat on its back. The stand is non-functional when plugged in, and the same will apply to any external stands or cases w/ grips.5) Not compatible with wireless headphones or other Bluetooth devices unless you buy an adapter. This is another huge disappointment, especially when considering the speakers aren't great... because Bluetooth headphones/earbuds won't work with the Switch out of the box. Thankfully you can find an adapter for it though... but it'll cost you another $40.If you can get past these major issues, which in my opinion are pretty disappointing for a current generation console from one of the biggest gaming companies in the world, then yes: I absolutely, 100% recommend the Switch as it's a unique and innovative little console with amazing exclusive games. It also has some bonuses: it looks really cool, it's modular, it can be played handheld or on a TV, there's great exclusives from Nintendo, it has plenty of built-in storage and the option to add an SD-Card, it uses USB-C, and more.Yet for the issues and drawbacks, I can't recommend paying more than $300 for it, and I wouldn't rate this higher than a 4.2 out of 5.0.",
