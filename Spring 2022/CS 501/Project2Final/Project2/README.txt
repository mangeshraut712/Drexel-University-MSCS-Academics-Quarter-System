READMEThis is a hotel management system that may be used to manage tasks such as maintaining customer information, booking rooms of various types, ordering meals for rooms, unbooking rooms, and displaying the bill. It can also be used to view various room amenities and availability. It's a menu-driven application system that runs until the user closes it.  When the software terminates, file handling is used to save the hotel's state (client details, booked rooms, meals ordered) in a file so that the old information is not lost when the program is restarted. When the application restarts, it scans the file to determine the hotel's previous status. The writing of the file was done in a different thread so it could be done in parallel. If a user tries to book a room that has already been reserved, a user-defined exception is thrown. To cope with any unforeseen exception, appropriate handling is done. In this project I use classes and objects, Inheritance, File Handling with Objects, Array List, implementing Interface, User Defined Exception, and Exception Handling, which covers all the parts that we learn in this course. The input would be given by the user for the multiple interactions after running the code. Users have good and valid choices to interact with the system. example Display room details, availability, book, order food, checkout, and exit. The output will be the result of interactions upon the user's behavior, responding very well to the user’s request and having fun running this system.Output * *** Welcome to Hotel Management System ****** DREXEL UNIVERSITY CCI CS-501 PROJECT 2 *** Enter your choice :1.Display room details2.Display room availability 3.Book4.Order food5.Checkout6.Exit Choose room type :1.Luxury Double Room 2.Deluxe Double Room 3.Luxury Single Room 4.Deluxe Single Room Room Number –  The first three options required room type, and the fourth and fifth required room number.
